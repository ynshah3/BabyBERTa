okay well there was a little girl who was walking down the street with her cat in a baby carriage and while she was what .
go head .
tell the whole thing .
the cat jumped out right behind the tree ?
and she ran along and she couldn't find the cat and she was lucky enough to meet up with a policeman .
before he could even turn around there behind him was the cat .
he went to get the cat and what did he do .
he stepped on his coat and fell down .
and the cat went to hide in the drain pipe .
and they all crawled out and the cat went up over the hill .
that's it .
the little girl was crawling out on top of the policeman and fell in the water .
splash ?
the girl climbs through .
the policeman climbed through and they caught the cat as he came out the other end .
the cat jumped on the policeman's head and ran up a tree .
the policeman .
leaned as far as he could and .
what ?
you think she's yelling help .
he grabbed the cat by the scruff of the neck but suddenly what happened .
the limb broke off .
he fell to the ground .
now what happens .
ah he put the little boy in the baby carriage and he walked down the street and the girl says ?
so long .
no she doesn't .
she says ?
i'm going to get some lemonade and cookies .
time for a treat .

well when david comes back we can ask .
i did .
david .
alright we got a big book here huh ?
okay .
great who lives in new york ?
well who lives in new york since we're reading about new york ?
and who else ?
uh huh ?
that's right they all live in new york .
they're going to greece .
yeah that'd be fun it's very far away .
you wanna go with me one day ?
okay they're going to a wedding !
exciting hah ?
my name is becky and i live near the new york public library .
some buildings in new york make you feel small .
but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important .
we should go to the library next time we're in .
wouldn't that be a great idea ?
it's like walking up the steps of a palace especially if you walk exactly in the middle .
the library was my favorite place in new york when we first moved here .
my mother painted me a map .
you can see it in the front of this book .
here it is .
she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too .
she said that once a week we could go wherever i wanted to .
if i could figure out how to get there .
for my first expedition i wanted to see real animals .
finding a zoo on the map was easy .
knowing where i was on the map and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder .
but i finally figured it out by turning the map .
once the map and i were both facing the same direction finding the zoo was easy .
have you been to the zoo ?
yes you have .
one good thing about new york is that most of the streets are numbered in order .
the numbers go up as you go north and down as you go south .
it's very logical .
so we just walked straight on fifth avenue .
i know i was going the right way because the numbers kept going up .
and at sixty fourth street we turned left .
sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them but at this one most of the animals aren't in cages .
the penguins have rocks to climb on and make their nests with and a pool to swim in .
you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water !
they were my favorites but i also liked watching the insects .
i saw a leaf cutter ant bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest .
what was your favorite thing at the zoo do you remember ?
yeah do you remember the polar bears ?
wasn't there a polar bear named lily ?
that's pretty neat huh ?
yeah .
tell me if you want me to take your plate okay ?
do you want me to take it ?
no ?
yes ?
i'm just gonna put it over here okay ?
while i take a sip of my coffee .
wow what's this ?
a ferris wheel ?
oh a carousel yes it's true .
after the zoo we explored the park and found a carousel .
i chose a big black horse with a lion saddle .
it wasn't like riding a real horse but it was kind of fun anyway .
the horse went up and down when the music started .
i had three rides .
when i bought my last ticket the man told me that my horse's name was bubbles ?
i thought that was a silly name for a big black horse with a roaring lion saddle .
hm hm .
when i wanted to get a birthday present for my friend martin my parents said they were going to the twenty sixth street antiques fair and that i could look for one there ?
they had a lot of antique toys like a china dog and a wooden horse but i didn't think martin would really like those .
i did find him some old baseball cards for his collection though .
mommy used to work right around here .
it's true .
yeah the twenties .
on martin's birthday i invited him to come with me on an expedition .
first we went to di yauto's for cheesecake his favorite dessert .
who loves cheesecake ?
i do love cheesecake hm hm !
my mother said they had the best cheesecake in new york .
mario yauto has owned the bakery for fifty years and his baby picture is still on the boxes .
his grandchildren work there in little aprons .
dogs were everywhere because a fancy dog show was going on across the street .
i like the dobermans and a little black bulldog .
there's the dobermans and there's the little black bulldog i guess .
where's the little black bulldog i wonder ?
no ?
that one's not a bulldog you're right .
yes honey ?
you want some more strawberries ?
should i get them now or should i read some more first ?
read some more first ?
okay .
do you know what this is ?
is it a big boat ?
what's it called ?
after cheesecake we went to the intrepid .
a real aircaft war aircraft warrior from world war two .
you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it .
yikes .
the fighter jets are real too you can climb up platforms and look inside them .
it was a very cold windy day and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves .
martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out so then we went inside .
we got to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats .
and martin loved it .
uh .
woo .
look at that do you remember what the name of that building is ?
that's the empire state building .
the next week we went to the observation deck of the empire state building .
we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark .
you could see so far .
in the painting we are looking north with the hudson river on our left and the east river on our right .
the small green square in the distance is central park .
here we go wow .
ah look there's central park .
yup .
mhm ?
that's the hudson river and the east river .
some birds flying .
martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours so for our next one we went to wall street where she works .
we met her on the spot where george washington was sworn in as our first president .
do you remember where you saw a thing about george washington ?
liberty's kids right .
do you know who used to work right around wall street ?
actually who used to work on wall street ?
that's right daddy used to work on wall street .
mhm it's true .
your daddy .
in the federal hall national memorial museum behind the statue i learned .
mhm ?
you want more strawberries now ?
okay .
let me get them for you .
careful of my coffee okay baby cakes ?
whoops ?
how many strawberries would you like honey ?
okay .
hello .
strawberry delivery .
you're welcome sweetie .
where were we ?
oh my goodness i keep losing my microphone .
what were we reading about ?
okay okay .
after that we took the subway to my favorite toystore f a o schwartz .
they have more stuffed animals than i'd ever seen in my life .
and they really are as big as my mother has painted them !
she let martin and me paint ourselves into this picture .
can you tell which are our self portraits ?
let's see .
that's terrific .
hm hm hm !
wow that's great .
i believe so i think you're right .
or the oh you know what i think wait i think i found them .
i think that's the picture of her that her mommy painted but look .
that looks like a kid drew it don't you think ?
yeah hehheh !
that's funny .
i said i thought they should have toys designed by children so she let me paint those in too .
guess which toys i made up .
the answer's at the end of the book .
let's see .
hm .
where ?
let's see oh here we go .
the toys that becky drew are called duckie designs because her parents used to call her ducky .
heh heh here they are .
that's funny .
okay .
on the fourth of july we went to the harbor .
we saw buildings from before the revolution and a little lighthouse memorial to the titanic .
it has a ball on top that drops down exactly at noon .
sailors used to set their clocks by it .
then we took a boat to the statue of liberty .
you did where did you see it ?
you and daddy saw it ?
when you went on the staten island ferry ?
on that big boat ?
how special huh ?
that was fun .
can you do you statue of liberty imitation ?
what does she look like ?
you gotta hold a book in one hand .
and then your torch in the other .
you sure make a great statue of liberty .
hm hm !
thank you .
then you have to say give me your tired your poor your huddled masses .
let's see ooh !
fireworks wow which do you think is the prettiest ?
oh that one's beautiful .
yep that one's beautiful .
mhm should i put this down ?
sure should i read a little more and then i'll .
mm i think you're right i think those are the prettiest ones .
mhm .
yeah .
ooh !
just before school started we spent the whole day playing in central park where a kid told us that grand central has a whispering room .
he said if we stood in opposite corners and whispered into them we'd be able to hear each other perfectly but no one else could .
so of course we wanted to try it .
the picture shows us running to grand central .
behind us my mother is talking about the chrysler building .
it's my favorite building in new york it's so beautiful look she was taying to us .
she alta also was telling us that the ceiling of grand central used to be so dirty that it was black .
but now it's a sky with gold stars arranged in constellations .
yes .
yup .

the supermarket ?
mm of course the museum .
i saw the dinosaurs at the american museum of natural history with my class at school .
and then again with my mother .
the huge one in the painting is a barosaurus .
my mother gave got me a postcard that tells what all the parts of a dinosaur's names mean .
for example dino means terrible and sauros means lizard .
when i went with my mother we saw the terrible lizards and then we went upstairs to something i thought was even more interesting ?
huge extinct animals .
my favorite was .
oh is yours the saber tooth tiger hers is the giant sloth .
they're both great though right ?
and remember when we went to the museum of natural history we also saw the skeleton of .
do you remember with the y shaped horn on the top of its head ?
in your book of extinct animals prehistoric animals ?
brontotherium right ?

the giant sloth was much taller than i am .
and standing on its hind legs with its fore legs reaching out at you .
nice y .
i made a w .
good one .
my w likes your w .
um let's see i also like the saber tooth tiger and the fossilized horse .
that's what you said you're right .
you are a smart four year old .
hm hm .
the fossilized horse which was much smaller than horses are now .
the sign explained how horses evolved eh and said they've changed much less than many other mammals .
when we were done we decided to have a snack in the plaza on our way to the rose center ?
mm .
the lights at the bottom of the plaza's fountain are arranged like the stars in orion .
real astronomers work here and everything is about space .
the huge sphere represents the .
what's the really big one ?
what is that supposed to be ?
that's supposed to be the sun .
the bottom one is the big bang the bottom theater is the big bang theater .
you look down into a swirling simulation of the universe .
the top one is the planetarium the dome darkens and stars come out the way they do at night .
remember which planet this one is ?
jupiter and remember this one with the rings ?
saturn .
you are right .
this one is neptune i think .

uranus .
where's little pluto ?
oh .
hm interesting .
that's neptune ?
where's uranus then ?
well we'll have to discuss that with daddy what do you think ?
yeah .
we took the subway home the stairwell had glittery stars on tiles .
i said they should have put stars on the subway ceiling too they way they did at grand central .
yes honey .
more strawberries do you think you're going to turn into a strawberry ?
i wonder what would happen if you called me in the morning and i went into your bedroom and you were a huge strawberry lying in bed .
what ?
ooh watch out because there's a little pickle juice on the plate we don't wanna spill it on you .
mhm ?

yes maybe later you want to show jenny your squishy pillow ?
okay after we read the book i'll go get it .
hah let's see my parents like the temple of dendoor best you walk right up to it and see the hieroglyphics on the walls and graffiti that the original explorers wrote there too .
but i like the sacred animals and the little charms like the turquoise hippopotamus what's his name ?
william .
who has a collection of little williams ?
that's right .
the turquoise hippo that protected a person in his next life from being attacked by real hippos .
they have lots of other things in the met it's huge but my mother believes that you enjoy museums more if you don't try to see too much on one visit .
the next week we took the subway up a hundred and twenty fifth street in harlem .
someone was selling little sweet potato pies right on the sidewalk and we each got one .
yummy mommy wants a sweet potato pie .
mm i love them .
mm sweet potatos are so good .
people .
you used to eat sweet potatos all the time when you were a baby oh my goodness .
you couldn't get enough .
give me more you said more sweet potatos and while you're at it i want some broccoli too .
did you know broccoli used to be your favorite food ?
yeah it's very good for you .
yeah broccoli and rice chinese broccoli and rice delicious .
you know who also loves broccoli so much ?
we used to .
mhm auntie and i .
it's so good .
auntie and i used to eat broccoli all the time when we were little .
um let's see people were selling lots of other things on the sidewalk too .
i liked the african prints because of the colors and i liked the smell of the incense burning .
that's an elm tree that once grew in front of an old theater .
people hoping to work in show business business used to touch it for good luck .
when the city chopped down the tree the owners of the apollo theater bought the biggest slab and put it on a pillar in front of the stage ?
on amateur night people touch it for luck before they perform .
it's completely smooth from so many people touching it over the years .
wow that's neat .
i guess that's a different tree .
oh it is that one ?
okay .
during school there was less time for expeditions and i didn't go on another one until halloween .
i went trick or treating with martin but his mother wouldn't let him come to the grown up halloween party in greenwich village so i went with just my parents .
my mother held her hands over my eyes twice but i got to see most of it .
which costumes do you think are the best ?
let's see which do you like ?
oh the little ballerina .
you know what i ooh there's a couple that i like .
ready ?
i like the bread .
that's funny .
and i like i think that's a jellyfish .

very good .
ooh scary could be a witch or something .
oh a bat you're right .
ooh !
a goblin !
the chinatown ice cream factory has flavors like lychee green tea and ginger .
i chose vanilla and my mother had mango .
the manager said that thanksgiving is the most popular day for weddings and feasts .
chinatown is crowded with brides in beautiful dresses .
mhm .
i liked chinatown there were so many food smells and all the telephone booths had roofs like little temples .
i wish martin could have come though he would have liked seeing the live lobsters on the sidewalk .
there they are .
on the sidewalk .
silly .
martin's mother did let him come to the new york city marathon .
we held a sign for the gallery that shows my mother's paintings .
because the owner was one of the runners .
let's see .
um .
let's see if we can find it .
mm yeah i don't see it right there .
hm .
when most people say new york they mean the island of manhattan where the skyscrapers are ?
oh sorry i skipped a sentence .
the marathoners run through all five boroughs but when most people say new york they mean the island of manhattan .
where the skyscrapers are ?
yay .
there they are watching the rockettes .
wow .
in new york the holidays start early .
weeks before thanksgiving the christmas decorations go up and the radio city christmas spectacular opens .
at the beginning of the show and orchestra rose out of the floor .
they played some music and then the orchestra went back into the floor and out came the rockettes .
wow .
there's santa claus and missus claus .
hm .
and those are the rockettes .
mhm ?
yes .
with arthur ?
no i don't think i got to it yet .
i didn't know arthur was in here .
arthur's in here ?
okay .
do you remember what this is ?
that's the hotel where we got married that's right .
it's called the plaza .
the next weekend when i first saw new york i when i first saw new york covered with deep snow i was amazed i had to go out in it and my mother had the idea of going to central park and building a snow horse .
so we did .
there they are .
on the way to the hotel my mother took my picture in front of the pulitzer fountain .
they fill the fountain with christmas trees during the holidays .
mm you let me know when arthur when you see arthur .
because i didn't know arthur was in here .
okay .
wow .
beautiful .
do you remember seeing the parade ?
mhm .
the night before .
turkey turkey turkey .
gob .
what's that ?
let's see your best statue of liberty !
woohoo !
good job .
the night before the thanksgiving day parade i traced the parade route on my map .
it starts at seventy seventh street and goes south on central park west then turns onto broadway and ends at macy's on thirty fourth street .
mhm it's true .
oh sorry we have to do the christmas tree don't we .
on the first night of vacation my parents and i went to see the tree and shop for christmas presents .
i didn't invite martin to come because i wanted to get him a present .
usually i'm excited about what i'm getting but this year i'm more excited about what i'm giving other people .
excuse me .
excuse me .
i love arthur too .
on the ticket i made for martin i drew people skating and the prometheus statue and wrote admit one student to skating in rockefeller center .
merry christmas happy new year .
we saw the new year start together on the roof deck .
of the marriott marquee hotel in times square .
i love you .
i love you .
okay .
sorry .
as the ball dropped everyone sang auld lang syne and we did too .
giant tv screens showed how people all over america and the world were watching times square at midnight in new york .

and to be a new yorker .

okay so she's wheeling her kitty cat in a baby stroller .
and what happens ?
yeah .
and then ?
the kittie cat hopped out of the stroller .
that's a pretty flower it's a pretty orange flower .
why do you think the kittie cat ran out ?
didn't want to be a baby .
hmm this has some deep meanings i think .
okay and so what happens ?
she turns around and she's very unhappy .
she goes .
ah !
oh no !
my kittie cat .
my kittie cat .
i lost it .
i lost it .
so the kittie hid .
and the flower goes flying through the air .
and where's the kittie cat ?
right .
right over behind the tree .
okay so what does she do ?
she goes .
help !
help help help .
find a policeman quick !
right ?
who does she find being a policeman ?
yeah .
it's not a real policeman huh ?
it's a pretend policeman .
a little boy pretending to be a policeman .
so who's .
what's he doing ?
he's playing with his his other little friend .
he's playing on a tricycle .
so what do what do you think the little girl is saying to the policeman ?
the kitty's lost .
please help me find it .
so what's the policeman do ?
that's right .
he looks right behind her and says .
oh you dumb lady .
your kittie cat's right behind you .
if you'd turn around and look .
use your eyes huh ?
is that what he says ?
i think he's got a big yellow whistle .
that would be fun to play .
so is the little girl happy ?
hmm so .
i bet you it's his .
these are all three brothers and sisters maybe ?
this is a big sister and that's a big brother and that's a little brother .
kinda like titch .
yeah ?
maybe that's that's the way it is ?
i bet you .
so is the cat happy ?
they're all happy .
but is the cat happy ?
no .
the cat doesn't look too happy .
so they try to go catch the cat .
the little brother is kinda fed up with them .
he's .
they're playing so silly .
so he's walking away .
he says .
ah you guys .
go play .
i don't need i don't need to play with you guys anymore .
and the kittie cat looks like he'd rather be some place else too .
so the brother goes to try to catch him .
and what happens ?
yeah .
what happens to the little the brother ?
well look right there .
the sister steps on the brother's coat and he trips and falls down .
kerplunk .
the whistle broke too .
fell off its string .
and the kittie cat ran away .
and what does he think ?
yeah .
shall we give these guys names ?
since they don't have names in this book .
who should this be ?
that should be titch ?
titch cowboy ?
okay then who should be the sister ?
mary ?
mary mother ?
and who should be the brother ?
some great names .
pete policeman mary mother and titch cowboy .
okay that's better .
alright so now they're going to try to find him .
he thinks they're going to catch him for sure .
so they're all tiptoeing after him .
and peter policeman says .
come here kittie .
come here .
he's beckoning like michael the policeman did right ?
okay and mary mother is pulling up her dress so she doesn't fall on her nose again .
was it mary that fell down or peter that fell down ?
you peter .
okay and titch is just kinda um coming along for the ride okay ?
so where's the kitty cat going ?
inside that big pipe sewer pipe .
uh oh so peter policeman climbs in .
uh oh uh oh .
this looks kinda of worrisome .
is is water .
this is a little river or creek out in the other end .
and the kittie cat is staying up on top .
he's the he's not going to get wet .
but i bet you peter might .
so peter starts walking through .
and i bet you mary's going to fall .
and titch titch is sitting up on top .
and i was right .
what happened ?
that's right .
peter just fell right in .
went right in the water .
kerplunck .
and mary almost did but she saw peter laying in the water so she look up .
and what did she see ?
the kittie cat .
do you think that they'd really want to get that kittie cat back now ?
or are they getting mad do you think ?
you .
maybe .
well the kittie cat's up the tree .
what's going to happen now ?
well peter it looks like peter is trying to help her get out .
and she getting out and out and out .
and all of a sudden she loses her balance and falls right on peter back in the water .
and at first the kittie cat .
what do you think how think the kittie cat feels ?
here ?
here he's happy .
what about here ?
maybe he's afraid .
well because here he's kinda the cause why everybody getting into trouble .
and he's afraid people are going to be mad at him .
you know ?
kinda like how you were feeling the other day about the books right ?
the books that wendy got for her birthday .
okay so what happens ?
they go kerplunck nose .
right into the water !
and all you s .
where're their heads ?
where are their heads here ?
that's right .
these are their feet and the kittie cat looking inside the thing .
where are they ?
where are they ?
so .
he's wearing the wrong hat .
he's wearing mary mother's hat .
and mary mother is all drenched .
and the kittie cat runs right back in the sewer pipe .
okay i think they're getting madder and madder .
peter policeman doesn't look too happy at alright then huh ?
so they climb back in the sewer pipe and they crawl through it .
and what happened ?
titch caught the kittie cat .
he didn't even try .
he didn't have to get wet .
he just kinda took his own time and managed to catch the kittie cat all by himself .
and so he hands it to to peter policeman .
and what happens ?
his hat falls off .
and then what else happens ?
where's the kittie cat ?
on peter policeman's head .
and peter can't see .
and he says .
help !

what does this look like instead ?
not jelly but gel ?
yeah but they're saying it's jelly not jello .
this is strawberry shortcake .
hm strawberry shortcake mix might come in a box .
but the strawberries wouldn't come in a box .
i'm not sure about that .
and here's a giant orange juice .
it's much bigger than everything else .
and that last thing i'd like some more of this .
this is corn soup .
how about this ?
i'm just gonna drink it in the store .
is that okay ?
how come ?
what would happen if you just drank something in the store ?
well you'd have to pay for it at least .
there's nothing in it because i drank the whole thing ?

do i want anything else ?
i'll have this piece of toast .
and also this orange slice .

it's called learning french .
that would be helpful .
do you want to speak french ?
you got the blackboard .
this one's funny it's called aunt fanny's cookbook .

anyway if we're gonna have a tornado we're going to have to hurry so .
let's put all these in here okay ?
are there any more rooms you want to set up before the tornado comes ?
what does the tornado sound like ?

yeah .
you've gotta be careful when you're chasing a cat .
and the cat's in a big pipe and they're going after him .

so we turn the page .
and the cat is up on top and here comes the boy who is a policeman here comes the girl who's a mommy and there goes the cat up the hill getting away .
and the policeman is helping her up right ?
yeah .
this is a funny book for sure .
and they fall in the water .
and when the cat i guess when the cat comes out the other side the little boy chases the cat cause they chase him through the pipe .
oop .
he got away .
and he's scratching the policeman .
that could be .
that could be the little girl's brother .
and there goes the cat up a tree and the policeman .

oh we have to unscrew these right ?
oh boy .
now we have a problem .
putting it back together .
i do not know .
let's see where do we start ?
well no that's not even there anymore .
i guess they would go in these pockets here right ?
that doesn't fit .
we need a thinner one .
now here's a thin one that should do it .
okay .
well i don't think we're ready for that yet .
uh oh .
we're stuck ?
i think we're gonna have to call for help .
let's put this blue one in here okay ?
now you put .
can you put these two here ?
i've forgotten forgotten what goes where .
well this must go in here and this must be this part .

we have a lot of work to a lot of work to do .
in fact if we take too much time maybe we'll do something else .

i can help you with that .
so she remembered you like spider man huh .
she'd probably would think there was something funny about spider man and what you and daddy set up in the living room last night ?
what did you set up ?
a tent .
the tent .
they set up a tent in the living room and they were sleeping in the tent .
a big tent .
how come your daddy decided to set up the tent anyway ?
daddy thought it was pretty cool yeah .
so what do you want to do boo ?
what's that look like to you ?
dinosaur yeah .
do you want to talk about your trip ?
she does not know what you went in .
what did you go in ?
to get to grandma and grandpa's house .
oh you told her .
yeah we talked about it ?
well i didn't get to hear about it .
what did you do ?
you went in a big big plane about as huge as this building .
wow that is a big plane .
so what did you do when you were on the plane anyway .
i don't think i know that .
did you just sit there quietly or what did you do on the plane .
you just sat there quietly .
were you nervous at all going on the plane .
that's good .
what else did you do at grandma and grandpa's ?
they were both swimming places .
so you went to a water park and a swimming pool .
wow how big were the slides at the swimming place .
or the water park ?
they were about as big as what .
as big as this room .
if i went on it my foot would touch the bottom of the water slide .
that doesn't sound very big .
i see the ones cody went on were bigger than the ones you went on .
it was as big as this building .
how come you didn't go on that one ?
okay .
i see you couldn't walk in the big people's water because it was too deep .
so where cody got off the water slide it was too deep for you .
let's see .
so that's cool you know what they call that .
it's called a kick stand .
i don't know why .
now the kick stand's up .
now the kick stand's going to be down .
well how about did you tell her about going to ponderosa .
what kind of animals do they have at the park where you went with grandma and grandpa ?
baby bunnies they were so tiny .
what did you do with those bunnies ?
did you get to actually hold them .
yeah .
were they really soft ?
you even petted them ?
daddy said you were even kissing them .
is that right ?
you were kissing the little bunnies ?
what else did they have at that place ?
chickens don't peck your finger ?
maybe they were roosters .
they didn't have the things that hang down like chickens do .
they could have been roosters instead .
so they had chickens there and horses ?
what about goats did they have goats ?
you're sure they had goats .
it would even eat dog bones .
no i didn't know .
i wondered if they had goats because they are the ones that totally want all the food you have in your hand .
and jump all on top of you almost right .
did they have that did you guys do that .
so then maybe they were sheep because sheep don't do that ?
and sheep do have horns too ?
that's pretty big .
and their legs were that tall so .
it sounds like maybe they were pretty big then .
i'm trying to think what else you did that might have been interesting since we were last here .
how about what did we do yesterday ?
remember you and i were somewhere kind of funny ?
do you remember where we went ?
we went to the mushroom park .
what were we gonna do at the mushroom park ?
we were going to do what ?
the camera broke didn't it ?
it's so silly ?
when had we gotten that camera ?
the same day we were using it we got it .
but there was something really strange about that camera anyway .
do you remember what was weird about that camera ?
what did it come with ?
a helmet yeah ?
it came with a bike helmet .
so it was a free camera that came with a bike helmet ?
and it was not good .
what did you take pictures of at home before it broke ?
really you got a new magazine or you got a new camera .
okay tell me .
so it's almost like a leaf blower but it sucks up wood .
something about your motorcycle i think .
weren't you gonna say thank you for it .
you're welcome .
we were wondering something about why she had given it to you right .
weren't you wondering if it was for your birthday or just for because you were a nice boy ?
i saw it and saw it was spider man and i thought of matty .
she thought you'd like it ?
she thought you'd totally think it was cool .
we were looking at it in the bathroom it's very cool ?
it goes up everywhere almost like spider man does .
so what did we do when we couldn't go hiking ?
when we couldn't take pictures what did we do instead ?
we went to the park and what else did we do .
what did we do at the rock beach that was pretty cool ?
we were climbing the rocks .
what did we do with some of the shale ?
we took some of it home .
no we didn't ?
i don't think we did ?
that was at the beach the day before .
yesterday we didn't take any shale home i don't think ?
what we did remember we went to the part that's all like falling apart into little pieces ?
and we were throwing it and hit the rock and explode ?
yup we did take that home you're right ?
we took the orange kind of rock home that is true ?
and then we did something afterwards because we got hot but we didn't want to swim in the lake .
why don't we swim in that lake .
dirty yeah ?
dirky ?
it was dirky water .
it is kind of murky and dirty ?
so what did we do instead .
play bowling you wanna play bowling ?
just tell me what we decided to do because we were hot from climbing .
we didn't want to swim ?
he took a whole bucket and poured it all over his head .
and then you were super cold right ?
and then you were shivering .
and then we were talking about the funny thing where someone actually had a worm bath .
what would a worm bath be like ?
how do you have a worm bath so that doctor weist will know ?
say it on the tape recorder how you have a worm bath ?
the worms talk to each other ?
what do they say ?
i see .
i see .
that's what the worms say to each other ?
let's ride the motorcycle because we've rode one before ?
you have to push those things down and then what does it do .
i makes it stops right .
what did you and daddy get at the home depot today that was cool for you ?
a garden set .
well what's part of the garden set ?
a rake and a shovel and a bucket .
all those things .
really .
wow .
so is it a kid's set ?
do you want to talk about going on our trip ?
where we're gonna go ?
we're going to be here next week but then we're going to be gone ?
where are we going do you remember ?
the ocean yeah .
are we gonna see any of these ?
you hope not .
you don't want to see any sharks .
any great white sharks ?
what are we gonna see at the ocean probably ?
kick butt barracudas ?
really well that would be interesting !
what did we see last time we were there ?
sharks .
shark babies .
so what do you want to do today .
do you want to play with the cash register ?
what ?
oh the bowling set ?
yes i do remember .
you want to do it that way again .
now what are you really supposed to do when you do bowling ?
so you're really supposed to hit it with this pin huh ?
okay one more time and then we'll do something else .
you can barely see through it how come .
oh my goodness are you okay .
i didn't know you were going to use you to knock them over .
what ?
you were pretending you were a pin .
you want to use the ball now ?
can we use the last pin then since you're going to do it with the ball ?
that did go pretty good ?
i just remembered something .
we did not even mention what we found the other day that we brought home in the bucket ?
what did you find ?
a shell ?
how about i give you another hint ?
we got it at leona falls and it was creepy ?
what was it ?
a crayfish .
i want to bowl again said the worms ?
you could be those worms talk right ?
so what did we do with the crayfish then .
did we eat the crayfish .
we didn't eat him for supper .
that was a good way .
i've never seen anybody do it that way ?
time to go home ?
how about a couple more minutes boo ?
why are you getting hungry ?
what did you and daddy have for lunch today ?
two noodles and a hotdog ?
only two noodles that's all .
one kooky poop ?
did daddy make you a new hotdog or did you eat the one i made you yesterday ?
he didn't know i made one did he !
what are you talking about ?
i don't think we need to talk about this anymore .
oh my gosh are you okay .

what could they do the wrong thing about ?
so how do you think we should try and make it so that they do a good job ?

because they might wonder how much tomato to give him or how much lettuce to give him .
how much he might wanna eat ?
he usually has maybe this much this much tomato ?
maybe this much lettuce .
his bowl is actually like this isn't it ?

i don't know how i feel about eating beans .
oh you did ?
you said you were hungry .
oh no don't put that in your mouth !
that's gross .
that was my bad idea .
because i suggested you pretend to eat and then you really did eat it .

what did you get when you got so many stickers this week ?
well what are you going to do with that toy ?
you can trace them ?
and then you got little sheets right ?
and then you'll have little pictures of them ?
is there anything else you can do with the spike thing ?
look at it .
aren't there some mazes or something in there too ?
this is sort of interesting .
what do you think you could put on this ?
pizza or maybe pie .
you just got a new one again today huh ?
wow so is one like the mommy cactus and one's like the baby cactus ?
oh i see so if it had this much more on it it would be the same size as the other thing .
oh that's a pretty small cactus .
is it prickly like the one that is in your room already ?
yeah is it prickly like the other one is ?
more prickly !
more prickly .
you don't say pricklier you say more prickly .
so how'd you get a cactus at home depot anyway ?
no why did daddy let you get a cactus ?
oh i'm surprised they all fit in the car .
what's this ?
this is kind of weird look at this bottom thing .
what's this look like ?
i'm not sure what these are supposed to do .
great idea matty .
it's really hard ?
you like this play dough .
or you think they should get new play dough ?

it's in the song ?
oh so there's some song and he says that's the pea the pin feather song ?

so far i think everything that you've been doing has been using the screw driver ?
all the .
flat tire ?
uh oh what's happening with it .
that's right .
if you screw instead of unscrewing what will happen ?
it would get more tight ?

and the cat is watching .
and the cat starts running down .
and they all fall into the water .
and flop .
and that cat looks into the pipe and runs back in again leaving them dripping wet in the water .
let's see what's next .

the water is just pouring off .
the girl is crawling back in back through the pipe .
out they go .
and the boy has caught that cat .
well the girl is angry .

well we went in shirley had a dollar eleanor had two and i had three .
the bill was five twenty .
what did you do ?
then i had some change .
we had no intentions of going anywhere after the wake .
we come out we walked you know all around and i figured it's so beautiful up there the fountain .
i keep meaning to go up there .
oh it's swell .
we come out .
i had taken the mass turnpike in .
as you come up from the mass turnpike it said no parking .
so you know we parked and said .
let's get out of here .
so we were in about two hours .
we come out and we couldn't find the car .
did you figure it was stolen ?
we couldn't find the parking lot .
we come out the wrong door .
we come out .
the back and the front look exactly alike .
aha .
you know they've got the big escalators to go up and everything .
we couldn't find the parking lot .
we're standing there killing ourselves laughing .
for an hour we kept walking up and down up and down .
my poor cousin shirley was so sick .
she had an awful cold .
we dragged her all over the place .
her feet were killing her .
finally we come against a guard up front you know .
he said .
i wondered what you three were laughing about .
we lost the car you know .
finally he said .
i don't know where you could've put it .
there isn't any there's a little parking lot way down behind there you go down then you go up and down .
he said .
the cars always get towed away and it'll cost you eight dollars .
we didn't even have ten cents to make a phone call .
we were hysterical .
finally we found the car .
it was still there .
it was the same parking lot ?
yeah .
the towing away one ?
yeah they didn't tow ours anyway .
sarah when are you gonna learn how to drive ?
yeah .
down at the stop and shop parking lot he had her sitting in his lap and she was steering the car .
are you good good at steering ?
mhm .
every time i think about last i start laughing .
what ?
every time i think of last night can kill myself laughing .
three idiots walking up and down the sidewalk .
oh .
you feel so silly and helpless .
we didn't know whether to go right or to go left .
nothing looked familiar .
we didn't know where to go .
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime .
i had a dime and i gave it to eleanor .
she put the dime in the thing that you turn ?
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went down you know .
just then the matron come in .
and eleanor said .
well i put the dime in and the you know i just can't get in .
the matron said .
you you didn't put a dime in .
oh .
oh it was awful .
we had a heck of a time .
anyway that girl was upset .
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said .
well here's the dime .
by this time eleanor was tearing you know .
and eleanor said .
i don't want the dime .
but i put the dime in .
she said .
well she was right .
that's terrible .
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to people who put things in just as a matter of principle .
yeah eleanor says .
i don't care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one we had .
and she said we didn't put it in you know .
next time i go to a wake with them i'm gonna make sure i take money with me .
shirley was ?
auntie shirley went with me last night .
auntie eleanor came .
every time we go over there we get into trouble or something happens .
last time we got in the elevator .
my husband and i went and eleanor and her husband .
we got up in the elevator and pushed the button .
we weren't supposed to be up there anyway up on the seventh floor to look at the pool .
we pushed the button .
i don't know we pushed the wrong button .
it was the emergency button and bells were going all over the place .
we took off and left him standing there .
then we got locked in one of the rooms upstairs near the pool .
oh dear .
everything happens .
her and her bright ideas .
sarah try holding it here and here and then you can move it wider .
see put your finger like this .
see how i hold it ?
you're doing this and then you can't you can't hardly squeeze it .
put it more at the end of your fingers and then you can cut better .
yeah maybe your fingers aren't long enough .
that's better though there is better than there .

no no no .
first you first you know what we do .
okay .
first we shake it up ?
nope !
first shake it up real hard .
okay ?
and the press it .
no ?
let's wait till you get the whipped creme i mean until you get until you get something to put it on ?
this'd be better hot .
you can squirt it yourself .
okay now turn it upside down .
and then then you just give it a little squirt .
you hold it with one hand and squirt it with the other ?
yeah .
got the idea .
now with your finger on the side you just press it from from this side press it .
i don't know if there's gonna be enough in there ?
well okay that's all .
that's all ?
i feel like having something with this on top .
well there isn't hardly anything .
i'll have some ?
you have ginger ale and whipped cream .
oo barfie .
oh .
well after seeing that house that betty last week i just never wanna be in a house like that .
why .
oh it's it's just too much work .
too much just to think about even if she doesn't do any work on it !
what's she doing ?
pretty messy .
i guess she had about two thousand .
you have one already don't you .
i'll take this .
here .
wipe it off on this .
here .
no give him that one .
you gotta wipe it off .
okay ?
wipe it off ?
that's right .
um this .
she she put about three thousand dollars into this um quilting business and she hasn't made any money on it ?
and she uses the basement for .
the whole house is like full of little projects that she's started ?
little rugs and things weaving .
nice rugs .
yeah really .
not not really that great .
i would say just mediocre .
when she's losing money does she realize it ?
does she realize !
why did they bring water outside .
the teachers have water to drink .
do you drink it too ?
where do you have your snack ?
outside or inside .
oh !
i see .
do they bring tables outside ?
or do you sit around on the steps and have your snack ?
oh no .
i'd better get a .
that's a little baby bug .
just a little baby baby bug .
cocoa ?
if you wanna drink it .
i don't even really want you to ?
no you don't mix the two .
you're not you're not gonna need eat anything .
find out ?
that's just chocolate soda .
eh .
i don't think it's gonna be too bad .
chocolate ginger ale soda !
the thing is if they're serious about leaving then they won't put a real fight to get that rent increase stopped .
i think they i think they prefer not to .
it's the matter of of the amount i think .
yeah .
yeah they h w what'd they charge for rent in nineteen seventy five was the first release that they had in a long time .
i just don't know .
no the inference from the letter .
yeah ?
that .
they had a ten dollar raise ?
when they came they were pay they were paying hundred and twenty dollars ?
hm this apartment was hundred and twenty dollars .
no whatever apartment they was in .
oh .
and they had a ten dollar raise the first the first year ?
they had a studio a studio .
yeah they had a ten dollar raise the first year .
in other words every year it's been ten dollars .
yeah .
i feel sorry for some of these people that that are on like two hundred dollar fellowships or something ?
how're they gonna live ?
especially the ones that have three kids .
yeah ?
you're you're sweet .
oh .
thing is ?
like everybody of course is going to join some kind of a .
or sign something saying they don't wanna pay more rent ?
big deal .
no it's a matter it's a matter it's a matter of having some uh .
legal ?
legal reason ?
yeah well you know it's that k elliot ?
i would love to show him up ?
yeah ?
my my feeling is it's just given him aggravation !
yeah ?
want me to try it ?
see how i like it .
oh it's pretty good .
tastes good ?
i like it .
having provided that that there is some justification ?
yeah well the thing is we just can't accept it without at least putting up a fight ?
right ?
you know ?
mhm .
you wanna go outside and play for awhile ?
i don't know if ?
you have to ask daddy if he's gonna take you .

i was trying to explain to markie that that he didn't the shoes that he had on were not his size and that i couldn't find his size in the store and that's why i didn't buy them for him and that we would buy them later when they ha came into the store .
and he was saying .
he was denying that they were the wrong size .
he was saying .
ross you were saying ross's are too big .
mhm right .
he has them on .
he has them on and he says .
aha aha they're not too big ?
so anyway he has basically denied my assumptions and also not following my reasoning .
since he has denied my assumptions i think he didn't care to follow the rest of the reasoning .
well yeah you're denying his assumption too ?
right .
his assumption is that if he can walk around in them .
then they're big big enough for him yeah .
they're fine .
yeah .
and your assumption is the right size .
is smaller .
is smaller and .
those are too big .
because ross's size is bigger therefore ?

they even have a trunk with a spare tire in it .
it's just like a real car .
hm .
member the time we haved a a flat tire on the road ?
we had to change the tire on the highway ?
you were there .
there you go .
you gonna take the whole thing apart ?
oh .
okay .
what about the other tire on the other side ?
these are the drivers .
huh ?
okay .
there it is .
oh .
what is that called ?
right .
a what ?
a backer car ?
what's that ?
oh .
that's called a jack .
it holds the car up .
right .
so that you can get the wheel off better just like when real cars ha have .
hm ?
i think you just need one .
i think you did that right .
that's very good .
no .
they .
when they put cars up they only do one end of the car ?
here .
is that going in okay ?
no .
not really .
ah .
i'm not sure if that's what really what it is .
but .
it could you could use it for that .
what ?
do you want me to help you you mean ?
so you can get done faster ?
okay .
which ones do you want me to take apart ?
you tell me which ones .
the wall .
you mean i get to do all that ?
okay .
i'll try .
you show me how .
okay ?
do i unscrew right here ?
okay .
okay .
here .
i'll start unscrewing this .
you want to help me finish it up ?
after i do it for a little bit ?
okay .
thank you .
oh .
wait a minute .
i gotta do a little bit more .
it's still tight .
okay .
now you could do it .
do you know how to put this car back together again when you're finished taking it apart ?
oh .
i think that would be the hardest part .
putting it back together again .
huh ?
okay .
yeah .
oh .
we've got one more wheel back here before you can take the sides out and and other screws here .
want me to do this one ?
or do you want to do it ?
you know what this part of the car's called ?
well .
it's a screw on this car .
but on real cars it's called a hubcap .
well .
it's not really a hubcap .
but it looks like the hubcap part of a real car .
yeah .
it's a plastic screw .
yeah .
that's true .
i think that goes from the front the .
that's the uh windshield i think .
do you wanna finish taking that screw out so you can take the side out ?
oh .
and there's the trunk .
here finish that one so we can take the side out .
oh .
boy .
and then .
now you can take it out .
oh .
oh .
look .
it's all falling apart .
oh .
i don't .
how are we ever going to get this back together again ?
here .
yeah .
i think you gotta go the other direction .
you're making it tighter .
do you have a car like this at your school ?
oh .
can you take the cap you go in apart just like this ?
oh .
oh .
i see .
gotta unscrew that .
oh .
it even has a motor .
wow .
and .
and uh here's a screw here honey .
and the those are the the headlights right ?
that's an awful big screw driver .
i think the one that you have at home would work better .
mhm .
right .
do you think it would ?
is it really lost ?
or is it just someplace with your toys ?
you gotta go the other way .
in what car ?
uh .
really ?
oh .
i think this is a really nice toy .
yes .
i do .
i don't know .
let me see .
that's unusual .
i don't know what that is .
oh .
i see .
it slides out .
you know what that was i think ?
i'm not sure .
but i think that was just a spare .
i don't know why that was there .
that's funny .
here it is .
oh .
boy .
yeah .
uh .
you're almost done really .
you know what i'd like to do ?
i would like to put it back together .
cause that would be a real challenge .
i could help you .
would you help me a little bit ?
alright .
why don't you finish that ?
it's not finished .
and then we'll start putting it together .
your uncle ricky used to take things apart all the time when he was a little boy too .
he one time he took apart a whole radio .
and he didn't know how to put it back together again .
well .
he just got a screw driver and started taking it apart .
and grandma betty got very angry cause it was a good radio .
oh .
i don't think anything very serious .
but now he knows how to put things back together again .
okay .
looks like that's about it .
isn't it ?
are there any other other screws on there that you could take out ?
i asked you a question .
are there any other screws that you could take out there ?
yes or no ?
right .
you're right .
there aren't .
hm ?
that's a wrench .
that .
you could have used that for some of them but uh .
some of the screws did .
but instead you used the screw driver .
okay .
let's figure out .
does this look like a car ?
it doesn't even look like a car anymore .
oh .
boy .
um .
no .
that doesn't come out though .
okay .
i think this is the top of the car because this is where the people sit .
i think .
okay .
now .
that means we have to put the headlights in front .
right ?
or in back too .
that's true .
this is the trunk .
over here .
i think .
it's not ?
alright .
le let's see here .
oh .
boy .
do those have to go in first ?
let me try .
okay ?
oh .
no .
they need to be the blue ones .
the blue ones are the thin ones .
yeah .
alright .
would you rather look at the book for a few minutes ?
and then we'll do this later ?
cause they want us to read a story from that book .
do you wanna do that ?
sure .
well .
i don't know if there's any words .
bring the bring the book to me please .
oh .
that's a tape recorder i don't think you should touch that .
would you bring me the book please honey ?
it's in that big box up there .
number one it says on it .
i put .
i don't think i could even get this back together if i tried .
okay .
let's just look at that for a little bit .
and then .
okay .
let's get on this .
we have to be on the mat .
come on the mat .
sure .
aha i'll try .
would you help me ?
oh .
you don't .
huh ?
okay .
it's called the great cat chase .
a wordless book by mercer mayer .
what kind of a name is that ?
what's that ?
yeah .
okay .
this little girl is is rolling her kittie in a baby carriage .
do you trunk that kitty's a baby or just a pretend baby ?
yeah .
is that little girl wearing real little girl clothes ?
they look kinda funny to me .
it looks like they're her mommy's old clothes .
do little girls usually have purses like that and big hats ?
no .
that's pretty silly .
she's playing dress up .
just like you do sometimes .
uh oh .
what's happening here ?
what happened ?
what's that kittie doing there ?
hm ?
hiding .
that's right .
the kittie ran away while the little girl was picking a flower .
and she goes .
oh my goodness .
see ?
she's all surprised .
and the kittie ran behind the tree .
and he's hiding .
and he's even smiling .
isn't he ?
pretty funny okay .
and the little girl's all upset .
isn't she ?
and what is she doing ?
who is she gonna go talk to here ?
is that a real policeman ?
that looks like a little boy dressed up as a policeman .
and he he's blowing his whistle .
and she says .
oh no .
oh no .
my kitty's gone .
and the policeman what points to the .
yeah .
and says .
there's your kittie lady .
the kittie was found .
and the policeman's walking over here to start to get the kittie .
but does that kittie look happy or sad now ?
mad .
right .
and what happened to that policeman when he tried to catch the kittie cat ?
i know .
cause he tripped and fell on his shirt .
it was too big for him .
what kind of shirt is that guy using wearing ?
batman shirt .
just like the one you're gonna get .
yeah .
okay .
so .
now they're gonna try to catch the kittie some more .
and they're walking up very quietly saying .
here kittie kittie kittie .
is that how people call kittie cats ?
they hit them ?
is that very nice ?
to hit kitties ?
i sure wouldn't like that .
no .
it is not really nice to hit animals .
people don't do that .
only mean people who do that .
so .
here's the kittie .
and he's walking to a into a great big what ?
right .
so .
they all go through the pipe .
and here is the kittie watching them from the other end .
and they're all going to go through the pipe to try and get that kittie .
and as soon as they get out what happens ?
he fell into the little water .
see ?
any the kittie just ran up the hill .
cause kitties are better climbers than people .
aren't they ?
would you like to fall in water like that right on your nose ?
hm .
i wouldn't like that .
yeah .
but they don't have their clothes off .
do they ?
no .
oh .
isn't that a nice policeman .
he's helping the girl out of the of the pipe .
see ?
he's very gallant .
but uh oh .
they fall again .
right in the water .
all their clothes are gonna get muddy .
huh ?
have you ever gone in the water with all your clothes on like that ?
that would be funny .
yeah .
that's true .
that kittie thinks it's awfully funny that they're falling in the water .
huh ?
okay .
why do you think that kittie has whiskers coming out of his top of his head ?
well .
it looks kinda strange .
uh oh .
they all splash in the water .
and there the kittie goes running through the pipe again .
and they are so angry this little boy and girl who are dress up like a lady and a policeman .
i think they're really determined to get the cat now .
but who get him ?
who got the cat ?
the little boy .
right .
the one that was wearing the batman shirt .
he caught the cat .
oh .
and look the cat is is on top of that little boy's head .
does he look very happy ?
oh .
i think he's scratching him .
he must hurt him .
huh ?
have you ever been scratched by a cat ?
did pam rich's cat ever scratch you ?
oh .
that hurts .
doesn't it ?
when they go can you show me how it feels ?
oh .
yeah .
that is how it feels .
so .
this little girl is very angry at the little toy for letting the cat go on top of the policeman boy's head .
and she's bawling him out .
you know how you can tell she's bawling him out ?
she's holding onto his ear and going can you do that with your hand ?
go .
you don't know how ?
hm ?
okay .
they the cat starts running up the tree .
do you think the cat's gonna escape ?
think so ?
look .
i can even see the scratch marks on the little policeman .
oh no .
they all .
he climbed up the tree to try to get the cat .
the cat's hanging on that little limb .
you think the limb's gonna break ?
hm ?
you tell me ?
what happened ?
he got the kittie .
that's right .
and what's this boy doing here ?
something not very nice .
he's sticking his tongue out .
no .
that's just a little boy .
that's not really a policeman davey .
it's just a little boy dressed up as a policeman .
she the great big funny shoes and the big blue shirt .
that's not really a policeman .
he just has a police outfit on .
okay .
anyway .
the police boy got the cat .
and the lady the little girl that's dressed like a lady is so happy .
and the little boy that's got the batman shirt on is very angry .
and so he stuck his tongue out .
and then what happened ?
the cat fell .
and the little boy fell .
see how the branch broke ?
that's what could happen when you go climbing on trees and d don't go on strong l limbs the branch breaks and goes .
crash .
and the cat fell .
and the little girl caught him and the policeman fell and landed right on the little boy with the batman shirt .
and they're all just so battered and tired and dirty .
and here they go walking home .
except this time the kittie is following .
behind and the little boy with the batman shirt is riding in the carriage .
they are so tired and so scratched up .
and the little girl is going into her house .
and what's she bringing them ?
what's she got on that tray ?
well .
she's dressed as a nurse .
but that's not really doctor stuff .
it looks like lemonade and cookies or or something like that .

alright well you know i'd like to learn about this one .
can you tell me about this one about him as a pet what would he be like ?
eat some of the cats .
oh well what does he eat .
he eats plants off the tree okay ?
does he drink juice ?
so i should buy this orange juice ?
alright you gonna ring up everything ?
okay do i need anything else you think to help take care of him ?
next time i come you're going to ring up all these dinosaurs ?
but what if i don't want all those dinosaurs for pets .
um hm .
they're not dangerous even the ones with the sharp teeth ?
see but i'm worried about buying all those because there would be just too many what if i don't have space for them at my house .
they're just little kid dinosaurs .
you think they'll have enough space .
so i'll take him home .
okay so alright well i'll take him home .
he's like the first one he's the starter guy we're gonna see if he works out okay .
alright because i'm not sure i want all of them but we'll check it out okay .
okay .
ring ring ?
yes are you the one who sold me this dinosaur ?
i have some more questions i didn't realize i would have questions but i have some questions ?
okay well i'm wondering about where he sleeps ?
i might have to go to a pet store and get him a bed ?
do you guys sell beds ?
as big as a house ?
i see well that should be plenty big ?
alright well let me come over and check out what you got okay ?
alright you said you got some beds at your place here because i really need a bed for him i think .
oh this whole thing .
no wait i don't want all the dinosaurs there's too many ?
i got to take them all ?
even all the plants too .
what if somebody else comes by and they wanna buy something else ?
really .
you have a whole other set of dinosaurs for somebody else who might come ?
i'm also concerned about how much this is going to cost me .
one dollar for all of these .
okay .
i'm a little worried about this one .
he does have sharp teeth .
what did you say the other day ?
i see he eats kinda spiky plants okay .
hard plants ?
so you're telling me he's not going to eat my other dinosaurs ?
alright okay another plant .
oh okay .
alright thank you .
okay great i'm set .
that what's that for ?
it's a little intercom so if somebody's in another part of the store like let us say so if somebody brought you something that didn't have a price tag on it you could say okay we need a price check for spaghetti .
then the person who's in the juice aisle will come and see what it is you need a price check on .
okay .
alright i'm going to take all these home here's your money ?
that's here you go here's your dollar ?
you just ate the money ?
oh my goodness .
i'm going to set them up over here .
hello ?
you know what it's so interesting that you're calling me because i actually have some questions for you about all the dinosaurs you sold me .
how am i gonna decide who gets to live in the best spot ?
alright thank you bye ?
well see this is the area of concern .
everybody wants to live right by the pond .
how am i going to do it ?
they all want to live right by the pond so they don't have to walk far to drink some nice cool water ?
okay ?
i see so maybe some of them would be willing to live up here .
mhm .
well this one doesn't want to live here though he already told me that because there is a volcano erupting ?
that doesn't seem like the best spot you know ?
okay so they just have to divide themselves up huh and find different areas to live in ?
then i also have another problem ?
this one here has been crying ?
he says that he's very small and misses his mommy ?
oh so we just got to make sure they're together .
did she adopt him because she doesn't look very much like him ?
oh okay ?
where do you think i should put my plants and my trees where they can get to them and have a lot of food ?
he's got a good spot then for the trees then .
wow that's actually really great i guess they've got it figured out now .
mhm .
who does ?
how do you know he likes to drink lava ?
bye thank you so much .
okay should i just call if i have any trouble .
okay thank you so much ?
i appreciate your help .
really .
good thing you brought your car back ?
alright let's say that i came in i ran out of green food ?
hello are you still open ?
i'm running in to some trouble right now because you know i put the trees in that you gave me but there's so many dinosaurs they ate all the green food .
um no the problem is there's plenty of water they just need more food ?
oh okay so they can drink milk awesome okay .
so no way this is like three different types of things that they can drink thank you ?
well alright well i feel better and what are these !
oh okay okay so ?
oh okay so this is if they're thirsty okay ?
oh you gotta ring them up right ?
you don't have any do you have anymore green food ?
oh you gave me all you had huh .
alright great job .
thank you so much i was about ready to forget your dollar ?
how can you eat money ?
don't you need the money .
don't you need to save the money .
oh you keep it in your mouth ?
hello yes .
well you know no not really because i put the food aside and i gave them some of the milk and some of the bread and they seem to be doing pretty good with it .
they're not they're not really arguing anymore but you know i'm afraid about something that could happen tonight .
some of them seem afraid of the dark .
what could i do ?
you just have one big one one flashlight .
oh you're bringing it over .
okay great ?
thank you so much .
you can see oh yeah this light is amazing it's so bright for such a small flashlight .
it's so amazing .
so all you have to do is open it up and squeeze it huh and the light comes out .
wow that light is so awesome .
now where should we keep the light you know because they're kinda spread out .
just anywhere maybe if i put it up here in the sky in a tree or something !
then all of them will have light does that sound like a good idea .
okay it runs on batteries huh .
yes hello .
well i need like three or four but if that's okay you can bring them over three or four batteries should do it .
oh okay let me ask them .
do you guys want some chocolate milk ?
no yes yes i do me too .
oh okay it looks like we need a bunch .
looks like we need as much as you can get .
they're very thirsty ?
okay that sounds good .
okay great you know those batteries are going to run out at some point .
you know i could use the batteries for other things too ?
thank you .
alright well let me see now everyone has to get in line in order to have their ah chocolate milk given to them .
you know how you have to wait your turn sometimes .
how about a t rex he's the first one in line ?
um hm .
he needs to be in front how come .
you think that's a good set up of the of the different animals ?
okay .
but where does he go ?
he falls .
follows .
okay ?
mhm ?
mhm ?
so he says i want my chocolate milk please please let me have my chocolate milk .
i've been waiting in line all day long .
yeah i think so he's next in line .
okay thank you ?
oh yeah sure that's a great spot .
so how about these meat eater ones or sharp teeth ones do they get something to drink or no .
hey hey hey you gotta share don't drink so much .
oh there is extra .
you're going to go get the larger bottle ?
toys for the dinosaurs .
that is a big bottle .
i was thinking matty you know what ?
we can play this game a little bit more but i was thinking leslie might want to hear about your trip to new york city .
maybe she's never been to new york city and she's interested in what you saw there .
no i've never been there ?
the statue of liberty ?
how did you get to new york city ?
um hm on a train and a ferry aha .

what if they don't get rid of their toys they might just get rid of their baby toys ?
they probably wouldn't wanna give away their fun toys now .
they can bring things to their new house .
what did they say ?
well i think they don't wanna bring that much because they have so much stuff and there's not that much space in their new house !
but they're gonna keep some stuff .
they're not going to buy all new toys right or games or puzzles or books right .
oh would that how would you like that .

there was long long lines of people .
when you finally got in you saw five no five on each side ten like booths ?
little gay like little teeny houses ?
very teeny .
just big enough for one person .
they was what .
and they was too little .
they was too little ?
did they let you take her in ?
yeah they was just big enough for one person ?
rachi and i went in .
and you push a a lever like a little button on the side ?
something you push down .
i think to the right .
and the curtains close behind you so only you are inside .
and nobody can see what you're voting .
remember .
and then you push down the little levers ?
like one says carter and one says ?
ford ?
and who are the candidates for congress ?
senate ?
congress .
neelea .
and the other guy i forgot .
but who's the candidate for this district .
nealea .
one who's running for reelection .
give me .
congressman .
the u s congress ?
oh i don't remember .
was it o'neil .
i didn't even recognize .
o'neil o'neil .
was it o'neil .
yeah i was glad ?
i didn't even know we was in .
thought we was in drinan's district ?
no that's brookline and newton .
um ?
what did you say john ?
i was probably taken off the .
then at the very end ?
give me give me apple juice ?
at the .
okay .
at the very end then you press ?
after you vote for all the people you want to vote like one person for president one person for senator .
you vote for different things ?
you then when you're all done you press that lever to the left .
but if you press two people for president it won't work ?
would you want to press the whole thing to finish voting it won't work .
it won't click ?
it'll be stuck .
i think .
well .
is that right .
unh ?
i love these mushrooms .
so another words um voting machines can't be void .
only paper ballot can be void .
mommy look um look .
and that's what happened .
got some .
what ?
look .
yeah here's donald duck .
then the the machine wouldn't work .
when you tried to press it off on at the very end of all your voting you have to press one pin to make the machine click ?
and that way your turn is finished .
but if you voted for both of them .
what is that called ima ?
the voting machine ?
the polling place ?
no what that i go in your box .
oh this ?
uh meat and rice ?
you want some more ?
yeh .
i want some too ?
okay me too ?
so if you didn't click .
if you voted for more than one then at the very end when you go to press it down it won't click ?
and it won't click until you change it until you change it to vote for only one of them .
johnny did jack teach you .
that was cute .
here john here's more ?
who did you say showed you a picture of carter and ford ?
here .
you want some .
oh .
and who did you like better .
what should he vote by look ?
isn't that all ?
who would you vote for john ?
john tell me ?
he said he told me before he would vote for president ford .
you'd vote for president ford .
john tell me tell me tell me ?
ssh he's telling you ?
rachi john who would you vote for ?
i think that sounds like the cookie monster ?
the cookie monster ?
i don't think he's running ?
oh ?
you like that .
i might .
i might make a picture .
that was at play group .
yeah we just .
oh .

i can't stand the suspense ?
you can't stand the suspense .
can you ?
haman .
why do you want to be haman ?
i figured you would ?
i just figured you would .
do you think um the chanakkah outfit would fit on him ?
i don't know .
it might be too small already ?
his teacher jackie asked me where we got his shirt .
mhm ?
he was wearing yesterday his shirt .
yeah .
so she asked me where we got it .
she said her daughter gave a friend who went back to israel a present of a cookie monster shirt ?
so the friend wants to have printed on it in hebrew or her daughter wants it .
yeah .
so the this is my best friend .
i don't know .
oh yeah ?
so she asked me if i know of any place where they print in hebrew .
in hebrew .
i thought what a fantastic business in new york that would be very goo .
yeah .
here it wouldn't be good .
i told her to ask the hebrew bulletin ?
they'll probably throw her out of the store ?
i don't doubt it .
what did you say ?
let's eat .
who would you vote for ?
i'd vote on carter .
when we went to vote remember ?
do you know what carter was before ?
he was a farmer .
this is terrible .
i mean .
and know what he grew on his farm ?
guess .
oi .
please .
you know what he grew on his farm .
peanuts .
really .
that humor .
so what huh .
i re i remember when i was in second grade ?
they say he wasn't a good peanut farmer altogether ?
yeah .
that's right ?
he left .
no .
he was never a peanut farmer .
he's a broker .
a peanut broker .
he doesn't grow peanuts .
he buys them from the surrounding farms .
oh .
and he sells them .
i don't know which is i don't know what's true .
who cares ?
a funny guy .
he was a captain in a submarine .
and he was also a governor ?
that's true .
he was in charge of the whole state but not the state of massachusetts ?
the state of georgia ?
cause every state needs somebody in charge of it .
supposedly .
john why don't you why don't you eat your meat .
you like that .
i remember when in the second grade they had a mock election .
they had a mock election today .
am i right ?
oops .
very interesting though .
you had to push the little things and then you push you push the big thing .
and then the curtains opened .
and you were finished .
and then you went out of the building .
and then the next person got a chance .
um it's very very good .
i go uh for ford .
salinger ?
tome salinger ?
well i don't even know .
oh yeah right .
we said we were going to hear your story .
what story is that ?
voting ?
we said i would say mine and then you would how it was when you voted ?
i ran up .
practically nobody there .
i thought it would be packed .
but apparently it was just after the lunchtime rush ?
i went into the booth .
i pushed all the levers on one line .
i didn't no i didn't .
i voted for .
register of deeds .
i did not vote for mrs hicks .
oh you know i may have voted for her ?
she was the democrat and i figured should i vote for the democrat .
and i i made i was propagandized by smith's ads .
no .
what i did was i i stopped for each of the resolutions ?
i read each of the !
i did too !
and voted .
and then ?
some of then had no opposition .
i know .
not the resolutions the candidates .
yeah candidates .
these was all democrats .
i don't think there was a single republican who had no opposition .
that's right .
whoever you don't vote for ?
well even if we voted for somebody else ?
isn't the president ?
yeah .
the only thing is that .
let's say we voted for one person but all the other people voted for another person .
the other person would win .
no .
i see how it works .
i took my time on the resolutions the referendum questions ?
all finished .
okay .
you have to urinate .
you sure ?
i made individual choices on the first four spots .
and on the rest i just went right down the line .
i didn't even .
most of them down on the on the botton was not um were running unopposed .
that's true .
jimmy carter would win .
i just wanted to make sure last time .
that what .

modesty takes over .

first you make a line .
a straight line .
you know .
now you're just being funny .
hm .
it looks more like an h .
she made a t this morning .
she was all excited .
she didn't expect it to come out i guess and look like a t .
if it's so easy how come you make all the mistakes ?
hm ?
that's hard work .
mhm .
what is it ?
it's a dress ?
a dress for what ?
for a person ?
why do not you you make an apple ?
i don't know .
it's an upside down apple .
the stem's at the bottom .

this is a w .
that's a w .
you copy it .

that one ?
that's hard .
do you know what starts with a k ?
what what name ?
what name ?
no this is an f .
two lines and an e has three lines .
see an e has one at the bottom .
an f doesn't .
oh .
you'll be telling the teacher how to write .
long as she couldn't tell why this isn't a z .
let's see .

that's the middle letter .
c a what for cat ?
it's the letter you just learned how to make the next letter .

find the a and put the a in between and that'll spell a word .
there you go .

now put that first .
put the j first .
and then put the a .
the other side sarah .

it has to go the other way around .
right .
m .
you know what that spells ?
no .
i knew that was a natural when she said c a .
it spells jam .
jam .
nothing .
the wall ?

no you make up your own language i'm afraid .
you're gonna never make a word out of that .
there's no word at all that starts like that .
you mixed something up in there .
that's a number not a letter .
can you tell which one's a number ?
which one ?
no that one .
you and your letters .
i don't know .

you can't put it like that .
turn it around .
no turn the e around .
that's right .

that's going the wrong way .
that sounds like when uh .
i think it was courtney one day had a list .

was the water really deep .
did your hair get wet .
no it wasn't super deep .
so yeah we went to the river that was a super fun time ?
because of all the river water on you right ?
yeah that was a smart idea to take a shower ?
that used to be the bottom of the ocean you're right .
but now what is it ?
definitely because the whole thing was ocean right pretty much everywhere was ocean .
that's why remember we found those rocks that had little shells fossil shells on it because that used to be the ocean .
i'm trying to think about something interesting else that we've been doing ?
we went to a birthday party the other day .
well what did you guys do at the party .
you're so excited to say what .
i'll give you a hint ?
the clue is three or four pieces .
that was kinda funny about the party three or four pieces of what ?

that was so tasty that what ?
it was tasty that you .
almost could scream .
well he kept taking little pieces of cake right and then i kept giving you some more and more and more .

is it a doll or is it a real person .
oh my goodness .
a real person is for sale .
oh then i can't buy it .
but you can't buy people .
you really can't .
you know what they call it when you buy a person .
they're called slaves .
do you remember when you were in the firefly room and they talked about those people that had to be the slaves ?
and then they went along the undergroung railroad .
so we don't want to sell people anymore .
how about if she's a doll ?
okay because you really can't buy people .

you think she's saying that she wants some food .
okay well do you sell food there .

okay well i'll have the ketchup then .

okay little baby doll come on and eat your jello .
oh my goodness .
ring ring ring excuse me .
i don't think the jello idea was very good .
she poured the jello all over her head .
let's see what this is supposed to be chocolate nuts .
okay maybe she'd like those .
oh i just wanted to thank you the chocolate nuts are great she ate them and she's probably fine now .
i won't bother you anymore goodbye .
okay pretend that we just walked by we didn't call you up but we came and walked by .
ring ring ring excuse me .
we were wondering if you know where she could get her hair cut it's kinda long .
a horse could chew it off alright well maybe i'll just sit her up right here is that gonna work ?
oh no ?
i thought we were just gonna make it a little shorter now she's bald .
you ate all of her hair ?
oh my goodness .
the horse would have to have time out because he ate all of her hair off ?
alright well look it grew back she's fine ?
i was thinking about what else we've been doing we went on a trip to chicago ?
tell her about what you saw in chicago ?
the tallest building where .
is it the tallest building in the town or the tallest building in the city or the tallest building in the what .
the tallest building in the world it's called the sears tower do you remember what was very interesting when we left chicago about the sears tower .
why didn't we see the top ?
so we were only able to see the bottom how did daddy even know where the building was ?
remember it was a little different from the other ones because it was a dark dark building ?
and he knew where it was located so that's how he kind of knew he said that's it that's the sears tower right there .
cool oh she doesn't know this story either .
this is a story that i was a little bit a little bit i don't know if i'd say angry about but i was a little bit hm remember when we were going to chicago and i told the lady not to give you the toy ?
okay tell her the whole story what happened .
well you didn't really beg for one but you said you wanted one but she asked you she said do you want one and what did you say ?
and what did she do even though i said no toy what did she do ?
she gave you one anyway right ?
but it was a cool toy remember what kind of toy it was ?
mhm it was cool push the button on the snakes head right and then the little big rock would come up and it would make the car go flying ?
you might be able to make that car go all the way up to the ceiling ?

oh my goodness ?
hey you know what leslie also doesn't know what's been going on with our car oh my goodness ?
what's been going on with our car ?
what ?
you're too scared to say ?
well first we had problems with our started and then they fixed it but then they didn't fix it entirely right and we had to send it back and you were so happy right !
yeah and then we had the rental car which you liked a lot ?
remember you were even kinda fussy and you were like you wanted to keep that rental car forever and i'm like we can't we have to pay for it everyday .
so now what's wrong with the car .
you said what do you know about this .
so what's wrong with the car now even though we got it fixed .
the window's broken what's broken about it ?
yeah it's stuck open we're hoping it doesn't rain ?
yeah we've had lots of problems with that car .
we were actually supposed to come here last week and meet her and that was the day the car we got it stuck at your school remember ?
oh my goodness we got stuck at his school and it would not start that was bad ?
i'm trying to think what else we've been doing matty .
so let's see we went to chicago and you started school and ?
do you wanna play with the dollhouse or the dinosaurs or look what she brought ?
do you wanna see what she brought ?
what do you think of that does he look super duper strong ?
hey that guy looked kinda scary ?
they are sparkly ones aren't they ?
do you wanna color any of it ?
he seems pretty strong i have to say what do you think .
what do you think about this face ?
do you wanna pick a page to color ?
oh my goodness .
he is all scratched up ?
what did you have to do at school with like the big a and little a do you remember that one picture ?
do you remember ?
are you saying no ?
okay ?
all the crayons out to do this okay ?
oh no that one's broke how sad ?
you need to be all the same facing the same way and the same height okay .
mhm !
oh what do you think about that is that all going to fit ?
oh my goodness ?
okay which you can have upside down i see ?
cool that reminds me of something that you made at your school do you remember .
the first day of school you came home and you told me about how you made a rainbow right that kinda looks like a rainbow with the different colors ?
yes ?
whoa ?
he totally does he's multicolored you would say ?
he's pretty cool do you remember what color the hulk really is ?
yeah green is that still your favorite color or do you have a new favorite color .
okay your very favorite's this one and this is like your second favorite number two ?
okay which one do you like next after that ?
your very favorite is the one that goes down okay ?
that one the light pink ?
hm cool i like all those colors too ?
let us see if i had to pick my favorite it probably would be ?
mhm ?
i get this group okay .
is this where i get to pick from for my favorite ?
mm okay because i think my favorite out of this group is probably this because look almost the same as my sweater today .
okay so i gotta do it the same way ?
mhm ?
we each have three is that how many you have .
oh one two three four one two three four how many do you have in your hand ?
and i have three so the reason we don't have the exact same number is because we have mister broken one here .
so nobody gets him right ?
okay which color are we gonna do which page you wanna do ?
this is me should i color the rose .
three different colors and see how that comes out ?
this is interesting you know why .
you don't really see the blue you know this light blue i didn't realize it but you don't see that color as well .
how did yours come out ?
oh mostly orange isn't that interesting you actually had all four colors but how come you only mostly see the orange .
okay ?
all of them whoa i got seven of them ?
i do not know you gotta count them ?
ah i think you have eight .
yes you do i only have seven .
okay ready what am i gonna color this rose with all these colors ?
okay ?
orange and then i notice this coming out sort of the purple over there ?
mhm .
oh we had to trade ?
yes and i have kind of this yellow green yellow with rainbow glitter it doesn't look like yellow .
it looks like yellow green doesn't it .
okay i'm gonna draw right here .
mhm .
it's kind of hard to draw with more than one isn't it ?
mostly i see .
green definitely green but your orange and your red comes out pretty good too .
the only one you really can't see very well is the light pink you don't see light pink really .
mm almost it almost looks like this color this darker pinkish color ?
could you see that ?
ah yup ?
i put your name on it ?
you write your name all the time at school now don't you ?
did you ever think about being with the y at the end ?
so you're just matt huh ?
just matt .
what if you had a long name like zachias ?
you know what's going to be a big thing for you to spell ?
zevenbergen .
if you have other matthews you might just be matthew z for awhile .
or matty or matt z ?
oops we don't want to break him okay that one already had a broken but we don't any other ones to break .
so we're gonna end up going pretty soon so what do you want to do at the end of our time here .
sell dinosaurs okay .
okay sell dinosaurs oh and drink milk .
alright so let's see now i think i will buy this one he seems gentle ?
oh is he gonna end up scratching my house and my furniture ?
hm that's no good so which one would you suggest .
aha .
i'll buy the duckbill ?
he seems like he's gonna be okay ?
does he need a swimming pool .
well see i don't know if i want the pool then because i don't want to have to take care of all these animals .
maybe how about this maybe i'll just buy the bed .
it's kind of complicated to have to take all those animals too ?
to the johnson's ?
what will the johnson's do with you ?
put you in what ?
and that will stop you from snivelling ?
what will you do with a lizard's cage ?
but how will that keep you from snivelling ?
that's enough pizza because you don't eat it all up .
alright .
oh .
don't do that joanna .
it's really rude .
if you need to do that eat someplace else .
no .
i just .
continue to talk but maybe we're all talking .
we were having a nice conversation mm .
mm .
and you know what ?
when we tape record it and then laura hears her snivelling on the tape recorder maybe she it will stop her habit ?
do you think that would stop your habit to hear how terrible it sounds ?
you hear it when .
well .
then why do you go on snivelling ?
because she doesn't like the noise .
no .
i'm asking laura .
why do you go on snivelling ?
what ?
noone plays with you ?
i play with you .
that's different than snivelling isn't it ?
laura eat the apple sauce in your bowl please .
you have to eat this .
crying when you get hurt is different from whining isn't it ?
mhm .
it's the whining part of crying that i object to .
i was crying in the middle of the night last night and noone heard me .
were you ?
maybe i didn't .
when were you crying ?
i don't know .
what were you crying about ?
i had a bad dream and i was half awake and half not .
well .
if it's really bad you could always come and tell us you know ?
mm .
i didn't know i was crying .
then i knew it i didn't .
that was .
i know what it was about .
it was about peanuts got killed .
not died by poisoning but got killed .
i see .
and made me sad .
that does make you sad to think about peanuts .
so i cried in the middle of the night and i didn't know why i was crying but i did know why i was crying .
mm .
look .
well .
you can always come and get us if you need us for something important .
i don't want you to come and get me just for the heck of it .
in the middle of the night .
laura .

oh .
oh .
well .
laura you spilled it all over the floor .
that's all .
no .
that's not alright .
but she did it .

i do not .
i said the person .
it wasn't you was it ?
mm .
i know who it is .
you know what you used to do when you were a baby when i fed you food like that ?
like apple sauce ?
you used to spit it back out at my face .
and he sneezed with the food in his mouth right on her .
aha .
did you apple sauce you both liked .
that you didn't spit out .
but practically everything else i made you you'd spit it right out at me .
anything else .
but you like carrots and apple sauce but you didn't like liver .
i went to all the trouble of making this liver for you .
you would take one mouthful of it and then you would take your tongue and spray it all over the place .
you'd go .
then it sprayed everywhere .
oh .
it was awful .
and you like beets .
those were the three things that you liked .
and cereal .
gokay .

but ross mommy didn't say raw she said if the strings get rotten .
no if they rot .
oh if they rot .
if they rot .
i see .
if they rot .
now that's different between getting raw .
if the strings rot .

doesn't want it to get in .
the wompa's an animal .

screw it together .
okay turn .
good .
oh very good .
don't wanna repair this ?

alright where does that piece go ?
i don't know .
why don't you open the front and see if it belongs in the front .
i guess not .
look in the back .
check the back maybe it's something that goes in the back .
no ?
i think it's an extra then .
why don't you slip it somewhere ?
why don't you put it in somewhere ?
there okay ?
that's a pretty nice car huh ?
what ?
oh that has a book in it for a story .
would you like to hear a story ?
would you like to play store ?
huh ?

my goodness look at that !
do you remember we saved packages ?

go ahead .
isn't it a nice little cash register .
what ?
i would be glad to .
but we have to get a screw driver .
and we have to take off the tire .
okay ?
like that .
yeah you just keep turning that then that will come off .
keep turning keep turning keep turning just move your wrist as you turn .
can you move your wrist ?
like this alright .

good you can use a screw driver or you know you can even use your wrist you can even do it like this for a while until you can turn it like that .

inside there ?
inside here ?
how does he get inside ?
i don't know i'm not sure .

i mean his head is in pretty good shape but what about the rest of his body ?

okay whenever he sees one of his friends he goes over to it .
the pterodactyl also ?

a hiking trail that's right it was totally cool weren't we totally surprised ?
oh my gosh though she does not know what we saw there what was that big big big long thing that we saw there ?
it was a snake it was seriously how big would you say that snake was ?
that's right it was like twelve feet long probably more it was giant it was this giant snake we couldn't believe it was just living out there wasn't it giant ?
do you remember did the people like it who were around us did they like that snake ?

i thought you liked that snake ?
remember you guys were trying to feed it ?
what'd you try to feed it ?
two snails and one worm but .
you think he ate them ?
he ate part of the worm didn't he ?
that's gross i don't really like the snake .
no i really don't well he was cute but i don't like that they have to eat that they're meat eaters and they eat like live things it seems gross .
you and daddy did something else this weekend too that was super fun on saturday do you remember where daddy took you on where ?
a ride park yeah right .
wasn't trying to think about oh she doesn't know about how you won !
how you won some stuff ?

five ducks and then you won a whole bunch of little toys like a little harmonica .
yes you did i know you totally did .
so we've been really we've done tons of stuff we went hiking a bunch of times and we hm i'm trying to think about another thing you did that you told me about that was very interesting do you want to tell the story about that girl at your school and the cheese ?
okay .
you can't tell yet okay how about if i count to ten and maybe you tell ?
fourteen okay .
okay let's hear the story .
you don't remember the story you told me the same story yesterday about her at school .
about the cheese .
do you remember the story do you want to talk about something else you don't have to talk about the cheese story if you don't want ?
hm i'm trying to think of what else we've done since you were here .
well there was one time we went hiking and we found something that was very tasty and you ate them all what were those ?
yup we kept finding blackberries and matty kept eating them and mommy and daddy kept picking them right and who kept eating them ?
yeah .
you want to eat that kind you ready for the next stick ?
alright well what about if you don't want to tell the cheese story what about something else that's going on at your school ?
do you wanna explain to her about the sticks we won't say anything about the yellow stick but how does the stick thing work ?
is it like this ?
oh what is it what is the yellow stick ?
and then .
yeah what happens if you do a great job that day what do you get ?
mhm what happens if you get stars through the whole week like the whole week or something what do you get ?
mhm where do the prizes come from ?
mhm and does she choose it for you ?
or someone else who ever gets the prize gets to choose their own ?
doesn't that take a long time ?
now you had your eye on some particular toy what was that that you wanted to get ?
but if you see it when you get to choose from the jar that would be good new right ?
you already got to do that what did you pick ?
remember what you chose ?
there's some what ?
that's okay you can talk about the candy that's fine .
there's a couple of different colors in there right ?
we didn't even start the grape one yet right ?
so what did you do when james came over yesterday ?
you mean when we all went to sullivan's .
oh yeah we all went to sullivan's that's true .
but what did you do when james was at our house ?
i do not know you guys were doing like a marching band for a little while right ?
a music band ?
after we stopped then you did a music band ?
what is that that daddy fixed with the batteries ?
there's lots of stuff at our house that's like that .
oh i remember you're talking about your tape recorder .
daddy put new batteries in it and now it works right ?
i see so you had a music band and you were using that .
and then there was something that happened with the money what was the deal with the money ?
what was james trying to do with the money ?
he was trying to put in there and you were very angry at him .
yeah why did you think he wanted to put it in there ?
and where did you want the money to be ?
out of there .
i remember that was right before we were getting ready to go .
so then we went to sullivan's and that was cool right ?
except you guys kept trying to take that ketchup .
what were you gonna do with that ketchup there ?
yeah i was a little worried .
yes and the ketchup would go everywhere .
that would not have been so good .

how come you got sugar in your hair last week ?
you were the fastest on in your class in gym aha and then ?

we did something i was thinking about running we went to the track the other day remember ?
what did we do at the track ?
your what you brought this here to put it in my hair ?

that seems a little strange .
do you wanna color ?
oh my goodness put that back down !

but how .
mark how come he let me go in come in to see the his blocks now and he wouldn't bef just a moment before .
he said because the ewok had was drinking milk up to his mouth and if you came in you would scare him .
and he would spill it .
i don't think that was the real reason .
i think the reason was that ross wanted me to come in before and i scared ross off and then i guess mark let me in i don't know because he wasn't fighting with ross anymore .
marky said i didn't woke up when he woke up but i woke up the same time when he woke up .
he's referring to the fact that i said we're proud of ross he woke up so early ?
and mark woke up only slightly after ross .
which is to say that they didn't wake up at the same time .
is that right mark .

scissors ?
we have to have scissors to cut it out .
really ?
how do you know that's the kind he likes ?
let's use this one .
we need a circle just that size .
a circle just that size .
thank you .
i'll trim it just a bit .
that's very nice .
yes it's sort of an egg shape .
now adam let's start i cut this way .
you turn this .
i'll hold this down .
you turn it .
whoops not too fast ?
you can turn it over and do a different one .
yes .
lots of different things .
not too fast .
a head of a turtle ?
now you can set this in different places and see what it does .
each time you move it it gets a different design .
i don't think it'll write your name but it'll make lots of different designs .
alright try .
what ?
until this writes your name ?
it might do something surprising .
let's make another piece of paper alright ?
alright .
it's a little bit too big .
make it a tiny bit smaller .
you like that ?
no i'll think i'll bring it back .
let's make it a tiny bit smaller .
that's right .
now it's just exactly right .
it looks like a big flower .
yes .
another turtle ?
no more ?
not too fast .
you need to go slower with it .
isn't that pretty ?
that's enough ?
okay wait adam .
that's right .
i think so .
let's try it .
it's a surprise .
not too fast adam because it doesn't work .
is that a turtle ?
no ?
what is it ?
the pen ?
that's what makes it draw .
no it just stays blue .
because it's a pen that's writing .
it could but then the machine wouldn't work .
alright .
try it .
alright .
do you want to cut ?
start here .
alright .
put it on .
no i think i'll cut it now .
yes .
just a minute .
is that your favorite ?
oh is that alright ?
what happened ?
oh that's a good one adam .
no just one .
shall we trim it just a little bit ?
alright .
shall i draw where you cut it ?
alright .
remember to go very slow when you're turning .
so you can get a turtle in the middle .
now you can change it .
silly !
i didn't think you were calling anyone silly were you ?
that's what i thought .
try it like that .
that ?
that makes it wavy .
it makes it wavy like on the ocean .
alright .
alright .
it's hard to hole it isn't it ?
sure .
i could draw around it .
would that make it any easier ?
and you could cut on the line .
that's good .
yes .
it's pretty good .
which way ?
oh yes .
there's one more piece here .
alright .
try them all .
push it down .
okay .
right .
is that what you call slow ?
that isn't slow .
alright .
i'm not ready .
whoops ?
you can keep those .
just be sure you don't get it on .
do it on the newspaper .
okay adam ?
what ?
press it straight down on the stamp pad .
it says six five four two zero seven .
it says the same .
you can change the numbers .
well you have to put it back in the ink gently .
six five four one nine seven .
six five four three eight .
six five four three eight .

you totally have nails .
fingernails .
no what ?
that's something else ?
oh that's the one we've ran out of ?
how about just magic can't we just use magic to connect it ?
well why not ?
so magic is just for fairy tales and stories i see .
and shows there's been a show you've been watching nearly everyday .
it matches your socks .
oh yeah you've totally been watching sponge bob .
we got some d v ds that each have like ten episodes right boo ?
it's kind of overwhelming it's a lot of sponge bobs .

why don't i think sponge bob boo ?
he's cool ?
no no no .
he's rude .
yeah why do you like sponge bob so much ?
no no no .
i know really who your favorite person is on the sponge bob show .
squidworth .
why ?
because he's a bad guy ?
i think squidworth is just really kinda i do not know he's in a bad mood like everyday right ?
so anyway i'm trying to think of what else we've been doing since we came here last time .
yes dear .
ah oh my goodness !
imagine if you were inside there and all of a sudden i came through the window .
here i'll pretend that i'm asleep and then you pretend .
what is that anyway what's the name of that creature ?
a lizard okay let's say i'm sleeping here .
ah ah it's the attack of the lizards ah !
man that would be scary wouldn't it if the lizard came through the window ?
yeah .
what do you think about her hair ?
so i have a question you were telling me about his one kid at your school what's his name ?
the one who always gets the yellow sticks .
yeah how did he do today ?
did he get any yellow sticks ?
how about you did you ?
so with dawson what does he do usually that makes him get a yellow stick ?
like what did he do ?
oh my goodness he bit mckayla ?
what did mckayla do ?
did she cry ?
oh my goodness .
how do you know it happened ?
oh .
the what ?
let's see the foot .

i'll get you .
oh my goodness what happened to that girl ?
oh my goodness this is a sad story .
about this poor girl !
after she fell off this alligator or crocodile fell on her too !
oh my goodness well then what happened to the girl ?
oops .
aha where did it go ?
it's very dangerous let's not do that anymore okay ?
you could have hit someone now it's missing .
i don't want to see you do that anymore okay ?
so tell leslie about how we ended up with your shoes yesterday where did we go shopping ?
so how did we end up with those shoes yesterday ?
what ?
well where did we buy them and how many stores did we go to ?
aha oh my goodness what happened to the farm ?
oh my goodness i think the bad lizards attacked the people and the animals on the farm .
they'd probably be pretty scared if all a sudden this giant giant lizard came to their town .
what ever you knock over you gotta clean up okay ?
just so you know .
well if you make a big mess you gotta clean it up .
so it reminds me seeing all these animals reminds of when you and i went to the zoo .
what was different about the zoo when we went last time ?
think about it what was different what was hanging everywhere ?
yeah why were there spiders at the zoo ?
mm hm .
you were the what ?
the mayor the one who's in charge of the town ?
oh that's pretty interesting .
now he's totally trapped for now right .
oh he's trapped .
i think this is a pretty big mess .
ah that's a giant mess this crocodile totally wrecked the whole barnyard !
oh my goodness .
so um .
you didn't say much about the zoo that made it so interesting at the zoo .
you don't remember at all ?
i really don't like this honey .

that's really funny that you think that .
it says the babies hold on tightly ?

so they won't fall off that's a really good idea ?
that's probably a tarantula .

what do you want ?
what kind of presents do you want ?
yeah but we wouldn't buy anything right ?
and then what ross if the sensor scope is missing ?
and we won't buy any toys ?
well what if there is a sensor scope .
does that mean we're supposed to buy it ?
what do you mean you don't know ?
what do you mean you don't know ?
you forgot the whole argument ?
no he didn't ?
he didn't ?
he knows very well .
he knows that i've said that i'm not going to buy anything .
he knows very well that there's a possibility that if it were there that maybe we would buy it .
he also knows that if he says that .
that he wouldn't get it ?
that he'd be in less of a position to say so ?
right ?
so he's saying .
well maybe we could just go and take a look .
once we get there then we can figure out how to get them to really buy it right .
is that the idea ross .
how are you going to get r two d two ?
he's being very noncommittal ?
how are you going to get your parents to get you r two d two ?
say nothing and hope ?
and what else do you do ?
what ?
work hard with your other new toys ?
show that you're a good boy ?
ross ?
poor dear ?
and maybe you'll get something nice .
oh i know another way you can get your r two d two ?
take your money out of your piggy bank ?
would you like to do that ?
maybe it's time to take your money out of your piggy bank ?
and then you don't have to be nice ?
you can take your own little money ?
you don't have to be nice .
isn't that great ?
do you like it better when you're not nice or when you are nice ?
when he doesn't have to be nice ?
it's better when he doesn't have to be nice .
you put that in his mouth .
he is nice so he doesn't have to be nice .
okay ross would you like to eat some breakfast .
no we can't .
how are we going to buy it ?
oh wait .
now wait a second .
if it doesn't cost a lot of money there'll be no problem in buying it ?
what do you mean even if it doesn't cost a lot of money we can still buy it ?
you mean that if it does cost a lot of money then we can't buy it .
if it costs a lot of money then we can't buy it .
what did you mean ?
tell me the whole idea again .
that's what he meant if it isn't too much money then we can buy it .
but he said even if it doesn't .
so he's got even if wrong ?
he means if it doesn't cost a lot of money then we can buy it .
what about even if it does cost a lot of money ?
then will we buy it ?
not if it costs too much money no ?
and even if he doesn't finish his breakfast ?
in other words we still have a lot of action figures to buy .
what do you mean ross ?
go ahead tell me .

your what ?
he's been very interested in spelling things like what sounds go with what letters .
sleeping bag .
what does sleeping bag end with ?
yeah sleeping bag .
sleeping also ends in g doesn't it ?
yes because you're not gonna sleep the whole night there but daddy has parent teacher conferences so you gotta stay at their house for awhile .
i just wanted to tell you though tell me what you think about this i really want to go to splash lagoon so i'm thinking maybe you guys shouldn't go because i can't go with .
you're gonna go but i've never even been there !
when do i get to go ?
i hope so .
ten days from now hm .
maybe possibly that could be a potential time .
yeah you guys might go to that one instead .
it's not exactly the same .
it's similar but its not called splash lagoon .
that doesn't roll real well does it ?
it's not like a car it's just a little trailer guy .
you need a car to go down there hm .
i do not know we'll have to see if they got a car here .
so what do people even do at splash lagoon since i've never even been there ?
what do people do ?
do you wanna see if this one works ?
oh that's pretty good .
alright i'll let you do it one more time and then we'll do something else for a while .
do you know what happens with this it ends up being loud okay ?
you won't really be able to be right on the tape if you do that .
so matty you're really not gonna wait for me to go to splash lagoon with you ?
how about you remember what happens next week ?
what holiday's next week and you don't have school for a couple of days ?
what ?
splash lagoon that's not the name of the holiday .
i'll give you a hint thanks .
right who's coming to visit ?
who ?
grandma and grandma ?
yeah grandma sharon and grandma zevenbergen are coming right .
and grandpa dale and grandpa zevenbergen are staying home right .
not your two grandmas grandma sharon and grandpa dale are coming .
what are you gonna show then in your house that they would find interesting do you think ?
and what are you gonna do with them ?
oh my goodness they're gonna drive in the car !
we'll wait until we're done with the tape for you to roll that again .
i'll give you a couple times to do it because it is loud .
but you can get them ready for them to drive if you want .
so i'm wondering about maybe if we should .
listen honey i thought we should take grandma sharon and grandpa dale maybe to uh .
no not to splash lagoon !
i think grandpa dale might like it grandma sharon would not want to go swimming there at all .
i do not know she doesn't like to go swimming .
i don't think i've ever seen her in a bathing suit .
are you sleeping ?
so leslie might think that these are really your real clothes but what's up with these clothes we got on here ?
did you just take the whole milk think and dump it over your head or what happened ?
and it went everywhere everywhere .
oh that's a beautiful dress !
and is that your beautiful headband ?
your hair cover ?
maybe this would be good remember how we were worried that it might start raining outside ?
if you had this on your hair would stay dry .
and everybody would say why does that kid got that on his head though .
hm ?
so i was saying when grandma sharon and grandpa dale come should we take them maybe to niagara falls ?
stinky's where's stinky's ?
oh there's an aquarium by niagara falls that's a little one though .
do you know where grandma sharon and grandpa dale have been before where we have also been ?
they went to lion country safaris one time .
we love that place remember ?
why ?
i don't want you to fall down though .
do you wanna be able to fall ?
well what if you hurt your head ?
are you gonna fall down gently ?
okay ready ?
lion country safari !
oh my goodness you fainted !
oh let's dump a bunch of juice on his head .
wait let's wake you up hold on stay right there .
this will wake you up all of these different drinks .
i'll dump them on your head .
there's nothing in these .
one time in the summer i remember you and i went to the lake erie state park and it was super hot and we dumped water on our heads .
do you remember that ?
a little bit do you remember that time ?
i knew you didn't it was hot and we were climbing up the rocks and we brought water bottles and we squirted them on each other's heads .
well it was fun .
maybe you just don't remember it .
real water ?
no no no !
it would work in here but then it would you know get the lab all wet .
everything would be super duper wet .
and then dump water in the bathroom ?
do you think the custodian wants to clean that up ?
i don't think so .
you know matty we have to write our christmas list soon for grandma and grandpa and santa and stuff like that .
well you just asked him for that one thing .
do you have any other ideas of what you would like for christmas ?
whoa i'd say that's pretty loud what do you think ?

so it became dark because the moon was covering the sun and the long necks thought they had to what did they think they were supposed to do to push the sun back up again .
as hard and as long as they could and that would put the sun back up again .
but there's another interesting part of the movie too who does little foot meet for the first time .

he had to make a decision if he was going to go back with his dad ?
because what was his dad doing that was pretty cool .
his dad was a leader of a herd so he thought that was pretty cool but then he decided that he was just gonna stay with his grandma and grandpa ?
so it was a great great new movie we just got the other day ?
so .

yeah .
how did you get up to the top there ?
um hm you took an elevator yeah .
was that the c n tower .
um i forget i didn't go ?
did it rotate .
does he know what that means .
did it go around and around matty .
the top part that you were at .
no .
i don't know .
but it was a tall thing so that's right though that's what i was thinking you took an elevator to get there .
there was a couple elevators .
um well we're gonna go up up up in the sears tower for sure .
you know how many i should tell you how many days until we go there actually it might be very interesting .
today's friday okay .
so we got saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday ?

well we are actually leaving for grandma sharon and grandpa dale in three days .
monday and then on wednesday we'll probably go to the sears tower .
are you excited for christmas .
what did you ask for ?
oh a remote control car .
just anything ?
remote control .
so i don't really remember hearing too much about that particular thing .
was there anything else you wanted ?
there is one thing that i know you wanted but um but then you said that somebody else at school was gonna get it for you .
do you remember what that was ?
what is it ?
barbie of swan lake movie yes .
so so he's thinking maybe somebody at school will get it for him .
oh ?
but i actually remember i was gonna buy you a dvd too ?
i'll give you a hint it starts with a w ?
wil .
willy .
we love that one .
that is a good movie ?
so that is a good movie .
did you have you ever seen that movie .
uh uh .
oh my goodness you gotta tell her .
what happens in willy wonka and the chocolate factory ?
oh wow .
do they get to eat chocolate .
wow .
one kid remember he tried to have too much chocolate what happened to him .
agustus .
um hm .
there was this whole river made out of chocolate and he was drinking it right ?
yep .
what happened to that one girl that was very spoiled ?
yeah what is she asking for .
do you remember what she was asking for ?
um hm .
what happened to charlie ?
nothing ?
what happened to mike t v ?
what happened to mike t v ?
um hm .
that's right he wanted to be the first person to travel by t v waves right .
remember he was floating all above them in little tiny pieces .
and then he showed up on the t v screen ?
um hm .
but you know carey is right about something something happens to charlie and grandpa joe ?
how did they almost get hurt ?
yeah .
how did that happened ?
do you know what was funny ?
how did they get down ?
burped all the way down .
and there were bubbles huh .
yeah .
good movie .
yep that's a really really good movie .
then i'm trying to remember so we talked about what happened on mike t v agustus glue ah what happened to that one girl who ate the gum .
violet .
and what did the umpa lumpas do to her ?
aha .
did they role her away .
do you remember ?
yeah that was funny .
yeah you're right though they had to take her to the juicer room .
it's totally funny ?
what song did they sing ?
do you remember it ?
how does it go ?
it is !
good memory .
i don't remember much about the rest of the song because they have a little different songs for each of the different kids right .
um hm .
so this is this is a very interesting part of the movie to me because at the end of it remember he first told charlie that he lost ?
um hm and then he said you win but what you know what this is funny what's the part of the movie that could never really happen ?
like what's the deal with grandpa joe and the bed .
yep he just got up and danced didn't he ?
that could never happen right .
that was totally funny .
so anyway yeah so that's one of the gifts that i got you remember .
you're gonna get to open it so you can take it on the trip .
i got it with when i was with daddy same day .
we had a good time at walmart .
we all kinds of stuff that day .
what do you remember did daddy tell you what we're gonna go do tonight ?

did you make it matty .
oh my goodness that is beautiful where'd you get that ?
oh my goodness you totally found it you must have been so excited that you found it again .
yeah ?
um can i see it ?
i won't loose it ?
that was a smart idea to wrap it up in there .
oh it's beautiful ?
is that a bead ?
um hm .
you know what it looks like to me .
doesn't it look quite a bit like a diamond .
wow ?
he is like give it back .
maybe what you know maybe it is a diamond ?
how do you know maybe it truly is a diamond ?
yeah to be able to put it on a ring or in a necklace or something .
do you know do you know where diamonds come from ?
compressed charcoal .
do you know what that means ?
over a long period of time charcoal gets pushed down by the earth and then it forms into diamonds and crystalizes ?
pretty cool huh .
go tell roman that ?
roman is really funny .
you didn't see him today but we saw him yesterday at gymnastics right .
yes believe it or not guess what he's gonna do tomorrow night .
what were we talking about this morning ?
oh wow ?
talk about what what you guys might do .
what would you like to do with roman and sophie ?
play what ?
play shoots and ladders .
yes that's a very fun game definitely a fun game ?
anything else .
and candy land too yes ?
where ?
oh i just didn't know where you were going ?
oh that reminds me though ?
what did we forget to bring back today ?
uh oh .
we have another car that we borrowed yes ?
that's okay .
yes .
we trust you ?
we took it out we just totally forgot to bring it back though .
yeah .
so i was thinking about hm well do you know about our what we're gonna do on our trip matty ?
well you know we're gonna go to the sears towers right ?
and we're gonna go grandma sharon and grandpa dale's .
we're gonna go to the museum .
which museum ?
oh the dinosaur museum .
why don't you come over here honey ?
i can't see you or hear you .
you can play with the car at the end ?
the dinosaur museum yes .
that is totally cool .
what do you think that they'll have there ?
yeah ?
i bet you're right what else do they tend to have at those kind of museums .
what ?
well sometimes they have animals that are like dead right ?
not just the bones but the whole animal right ?
yeah so you can see what the animals look like ?
it's almost like a zoo kinda right .
except ?
when they try to you know they set up the dioramas and displays and stuff ?
yep .
in their little natural habitats ?
but you had an idea he was so funny remember matty you said how many days are we gonna be at grandma sharon's and grandpa dales and i said four and he said well that should be enough days because he wanted to go to my parents actually live an hour and a half from chicago .
um hm .
so he was like well that will give us three days one day to go to sears towers right one day to go to the dinosaur museum and what was the other place you wanted to go ?
oh you don't remember !
hm you went there this summer with daddy and you and daddy had a really good time .
you still don't remember .
let me give you a hint ?
oh now you remember okay what .
oh wow .
aquarium but we decided we probably will only go to chicago one one day .
sears towers and dinosaur museum right .
in one day ?
it's gonna be a long day right ?
yeah .
yeah .
and then also on the trip you're gonna go visit ?
grandma and grandpa .
yes ?
what do you think you'll do there ?
are you gonna eat ?
what will you have ?
what's your favorite food ?
you say that ?
i think that's probably true you tend to choose those a lot ?
or noodles you tend to like curly noodles cheesy noodles right .
pizza .
i know what i would say your favorite food is .
i gonna have a new guess ?
okay and then tell me which one truly is your favorite .
could it possibly be mozzarella sticks cheese sticks ?
do you like those better than chicken nuggets or you like chicken nuggets better ?
which one do you eat more ?
um more recently you probably eat the cheese sticks a little bit more often .
cheese sticks ?
so at grandma grandma and grandpa zevenburgen's we don't do that many specific things .
we tend to just visit ?
because there's lots of family there right .
cody and kaylia and heidi and the new baby and and then jaden right .
yeah they probably don't know who jaden is though .
who is jaden ?
you forget .
because you haven't seen here in a long time that's true probably ?
you know what .
i just was thinking it might actually be two years since you've seen jaden ?
whoa that is a long time honey ?
that's amazing .
i could be right though yeah ?
anyway that's his cousin but we don't really see them because cody and kaylia they came with us .

remember last night i went bowling and i was thinking that you might wanna go bowling too .
it is only on sundays for kids .
oh .
you wanna try it with big people's what ?
to go bowling yeah because that's the thing on sunday afternoons they have little pins .
or i think the pins are the same size but they have lighter balls because balls can be very heavy to throw bowling balls .
it's going to be fun though isn't it ?
you gotta see if you can get a strike and knock all of them down right ?
those are gonna be really loud .

but if you had had the yellow stick still .
bed early .
what time is you have to go to bed if it's early ?

ding dong .
ding dong rang the bells in the church steeple .

her ding dongs sounded a bit squeaky but cheeky didn't mind ?
she loved to sing .

yes .
you go to church to say goodbye when somebody dies .
but that's not really a carnival .
yes .
nana goes to church every week ?
no .
some people go to church not to say goodbye .
some people just go to church .
it's their way of talking with god .
but we don't do that .
pokky does .
amina does .
i don't know because i've never seen god ?
yes .
he is invisible .
would you like to go and visit inside a church sometime .
just look around .
right .
alright .
it's nothing to be scared of .
alright .
very big room laura .
with places to sit .
rows of seats to sit on so that people can listen to people talk .
look inside of the church and in some churches and synagogues there are beautiful stained glass windows .
there's a part inside of a church .
there is god in the church ?
well .
god is inside of the people who think about him when they go to church .
the church is a special place for them to go and think about ?
well .
there are some people who believe that .
yes .
it's very confusing about god .
i don't understand very well about god myself .
about god ?
yeah .
i i have trouble explaining it to you laura ?
because i don't know the answer !
i don't think daddy knows the answer about god either .
maybe .
what what would you like to know and maybe i can help you ?
who ?
oh .
what ?
people meet together to talk and to sing and to celebrate thinking about god but they can't really see him ?
he's not something that we can see ?
he's something that we can talk about and think about but he's not something that we can put our hands on and touch and see ?
well .
i have never heard him talk .
maybe .
that's possible that he's an invisible person .
that's true .
maybe he could what .
yes .
but invisible things can move around .
that's right .
that's right .
maybe he's right here in this room and we can't see him or hear him or smell him or hear him .
well .
yeah .
i'm not invisible am i .
and i could love you too .
maybe we'd better .
well .
we can talk about it .
i don't mind talking about it .
you don't wanna or you do wanna .
oh .
well ?
we're not gonna listen to this .
her ding dongs sounded a bit squeaky but cheeky didn't mind .
she loved to sing .
just then a little bird flew down onto the window sill .
tweet .
tweet he sang .
tweet .
tweet .
cheeky blew her whistle .
the little bird didn't wait to hear her song .
he flew away but cheeky didn't mind .
while she combed her hair she remembered another way to make music .
by a comb .
that's right .
she put a piece of paper over her comb then she hummed through it's teeth .
she loved the tingling music even though it made her shiver .
downstairs the tea kettle was whistling .
cheeky whistled too .
her whistle was as loud as a dozen tea kettles ?
at breakfast cheeky used her spoon to tap a tune on her milk glass .
on her plate .
on the sugar bowl and on the coffee pot .
each time she made a different up and down musical sound .
please kiki .
not so much noise at the breakfast table said daddy ?
kiki stopped ?
she couldn't understand why daddy didn't like her music ?
huh ?
too loud .
yeah .
after breakfast she decided to have a concert with muffy her cat but muffy doesn't care about music either .
why doesn't muffy like that music .
i don't either .
it must not be very good music .
he ran away when kiki tried to blow her horn and beat her drum at the same time .
after her nap kiki still wanted music .
she and her playmates were having a fine concert ?
boom .
boom .
screech .
screech .
toot .
toot .
it sounded wonderful to kiki .
but when daddy came home to put his hands over his ears .
excuse me .
but when daddy came home he put his hands over his ears .
what a noise he cried .
it's time kiki learns the difference between music and noise .
she is big enough to learn to play real music .
so the next day daddy and kiki went to the music store ?
first the man in the store showed kiki the small violin .
squeak went the bow across the string .
not this one said kiki .
next she tried a cello .
it was too tall .
you make a cello noise .
you know the cello .
the tuba was too big and too hard to blow .
that's the tuba .
right .
the harp was beautiful but it looked big too .
no .
you're not bigger than a harp is .
a harp is even bigger than i am .
it's a very large instrument .
perhaps .
that's the one you're gonna choose is the harp .
well .
i don't know .
we'll have trouble finding you a teacher to help you learn how to play the harp laura .
that's a very unusual instrument .
maybe they do have a good child harp .
i don't know .
then the then the music man store .
excuse me .
then the music store man played pop goes the weasel on the piano .
that's right .
that's what it says .
so she didn't think a piano was a bit too big .
piano was what she wanted most of all .
then they picked out a piano that was just the right size for kiki .
on the way home kiki and daddy did the hurdy gurdy dance ?
oh daddy ?
that would be fun to play too kiki said .
a piano will be enough said daddy .
kiki's piano came in a big truck .
she wanted to play so she banged on the keys .
she tried sitting on the stool .
she tried standing up to reach the pedals but no tune came out .
just noise .
the next day miss dingle came to teach kiki how to play the piano .
she showed her where to put her fingers on the keyboard and how to play notes .
kiki thought it was hard to use all her fingers .
she wanted to use just one finger and play pop goes the weasel .
finally mother said kiki let's have a surprise .
if you will try to use all your fingers i will try to teach you a song for a very special day that is coming soon .
kiki loved the idea of a surprise .
happy birthday dear daddy .

we've got everything working .
what are you doing with the sponge ?
i don't think you'd better do that nomi because you splash it over .

we can't have any splashing out of the tub because that man's coming to put the tile on the floor and he can't work on a wet floor .
don't drop it please .
oh nomi whoops !
oh don't .
oh boy .
because you're getting all that stuff into the tub .
well because that's not where it belongs .
if it's in the tub now it's gonna get in your hair later on .

are you warm enough in there naomi ?
well i guess there's nothing you can do about that .
naomi tell me about the summer again .

you walked slowlyer ?
it's on .
you can speak right now .
we've been speaking into it all this time .
oh no you can't hold it naomi .
not when you're in the tub .
that's dangerous .
that can naomi for the same reason naomi that you can't play with plugs .
didn't you hear it before when we played it back ?
okay .
well i'm going to put some more hot water in the tub and we'll play it back .
and you can listen to your voice while the hot water runs into the tub .
okay .
i've put the tape recorder on again .
nomi tell me what happened on the way home today when you were riding in the car with jacqueline and there was somebody on a bicycle .

when you were in the car ?
i think in the car she had said .
if we were we would have .
can you finish it ?
we would have .
oh somebody's at the door .
you talk into the tape recorder for a minute while i get the door .
nomi's in the tub .
mhm .
how did you get that scratch ?
never did hurt very much did it ?
you want what ?
well that was all there was nomi .
well i'm afraid we've erased that part now .
well there's no way of getting that any more because we're tape recording over it .
what else would you like to talk about ?
do you want to tell me another story ?
make up another story ?
it'd be nice .
tell me a story nomi .
okay .
sure .
now you have to speak clearly naomi .
nomi remember the tape recorder has trouble understanding so you have to speak clearly for the tape recorder .
no it listens .
it just listens .
sometimes it talks .
i guess when it plays back it talks doesn't it ?
and what about naomi ?
oh well maybe she's with the pineapple .
where is she ?
i don't see her .
and who are you pointing to ?
don't pick at those nomi please .
wallpaper fell off the pillow ?
put meatballs on them ?
and did what ?
even on the toilet paper .
nomi it'd be good if you came down to this side of the tub where the microphone is .
it had a funny shaped body ?
oh for a poo poo .
and it lived happily ever after ?
are you ready to get you hair washed now ?
we'll turn this off while you get your hair washed .
what do you want to say now ?
okay one more story and then you come out of the tub .
mhm .
can i throw this out naomi ?
i'm not understanding any of this either if you're having trouble transcribing .
remember nomi um if you wanna record you have to just talk would be better because it's awfully hard to understand .
it doesn't help that she's got a bit of a head cold .
nomi why don't you tell us tell us what you're doing with the frog .
why is it hopping ?
where is it going ?
it doesn't know where ?
i see .
she's got the frog's leg through the fish eye .
naomi i'd like you to say some to say a sentence .
first the way you would say it and then the way some other people would say the same thing .
let's say how about .
it's time for a bath tonight .
you say that just the way you would say it .
okay now say it the way jacqueline would say it .
say it the way i would say it .
how would a baby say it ?
how would a boy say it ?
how would a girl say it ?
how would a man say it ?
how would a woman say it ?
okay nomi in two minutes you'll come out of the tub .
i guess that was the water running out of it .
if fish get out of the water ?
yes .
naomi time now to come out of the tub .
if you want dessert and time to play upstairs you have to come out now .
you can just leave the water in there and it'll come out .
when frogs get in the water nomi they get water inside them ?

adam's taller .
oh no you won't want any dinner .
i'd like to sit in this chair if it's alright with you .

you can tie it go ahead .
if you can't tie it maybe robin can tie it .

now you can give them to robin and he can give them to his mother and we'll both have flowers .
i'll give them back now adam .
where's the box ?
that's not a box .
it's supposed to be a case .
what ?
well then i guess the nurses would have to take care of people .
well we really would have quite a few sick people .
then maybe each person would have to take care of himself .
alright .
don't take his things adam .
here you are adam .
you can't even what ?
they're cotton balls .
for cleaning things .
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton .
diandra why are you tearing it up ?
that's right .
what time is it adam ?
oh dear .
maybe you should keep the things we want to keep away from there .
diandra no .
you're tearing up too much .
that wouldn't be nice to do .

oh it looks much better ?
it really does .
you're really getting well .
okay let's get your socks on .
you scratch it with your finger .

different colors .
yeah as soon as i get your hair done .
well i think it won't record if you don't ?
we don't want to have one side of your hair with no more tangles and the other side not have because then you'd have one tangles side and that would be silly wouldn't it .
and we'd keep wondering hm why is one side of your hair all tangled and the other side nice and smooth ?

okay .
okay wanna listen to what it sounds like now .
okay there's just a little more tape left on nomi not too much so you can tape what's left okay .

nomi you didn't have your vitamins this morning did you .

do you feel inhibited when i'm here ?
this is continuing from the other side .
this is february seven and nomi wants to finish her sentence .
okay now ?
honey ?
you don't have to hold the microphone actually that close to your mouth ?
hold a little further away and we'll just hang the microphone over the side here and you can play with your animals and stuff and still record ?
would you like to do that ?
hm .
okay .
you do whatever you want just don't push any buttons ?
okay and try not to drop the microphone .
how's everything in here going honey ?
please don't hold the microphone right up to your mouth honey .
if it gets wet inside there it's very bad for it honey .
so don't put it on your mouth .
hold it yeah about that distance away from you is fine ?
yeah but it actually doesn't even need to be held honey ?
it could just be ?
you can have it just hanging off the chair and then you have both of your hands free to play and you'd still be talking into the microphone .
don't use the microphone like that honey your lips are on the microphone .
remember to hold it away .
okay .
the reason is it doesn't record well and it ruins the microphone .

oh so she's going to be very curious as to what you are gonna be making .
what are you planning on here ?
you know how to make him ?
wow that's a great idea since you've been talking about him at school .
what do you know about abraham lincloln ?
we talked about him a little bit yesterday what did he do that was important that he said about the people that were slaves ?
no more slave states that's right he said no more slave states that's right .
yeah what did he think about the people that were a different color ?
he thought what ?
should we treat them differently should we make them sit in the back of the bus or make them be slaves what did he think ?
uh hum everybody should be considered equal right ?
uh hum .
we haven't really talked about this too much are there any other presidents you talked about at school ?
who else ?
did you talk about george washington ?
yeah do you remember anything about him ?
no i don't really know too much except he was the first president .
yeah that's pretty cool .
so we've been doing lots of stuff since we saw her because one of the things that's been very exciting was is a couple a days ago there was valentine's day !
yeah .
so what did you do for you school for valentine's day ?
you brought valentines .
for ?
uh hum .
now did you just bring them to the kids you are really are good friends with or what ?
that's nice .
yeah .
and so how did you how do we know who's valentine's is who what did you have to do ?
uh hum write the names on every valentine yep .
that was pretty cool .
and then what did you end up getting from your classroom on valentine's day ?
uh hum is that it just the paper valentines anything else ?
yeah .
some toys some pencils .
some kids brought pencils some people brought candy yep .
that is awesome .
you drew the hair mostly yep yep i see the hair on him .
uh hum you can see it it's light but you can definitely see it .
what do you think would that be a good idea ?
yeah maybe then we can see it a little better .
is .
you're gonna try that one try that pink .
well we did something that was super fun on sunday saturday night do you remember what did we go see as a whole family where did we go ?
well we drove there i'll give you a little hint there were some fireworks !
so what did we see there besides fireworks ?
the ice castles .
okay so what's an ice castle anyway ?
and then what else was right by there besides an ice castle what else was kind of near there surrounding the ice castle ?
some what ?
you're trying to remember the word right ?
they were ice sculptures .
yeah we saw lots of ice sculptures .
some of them were broken though by the time we went that was disappointing .
and what were some of the other kids doing that evening ?
that we thought it was kind of too cold maybe to do or too icy what were some of the kids doing there ?
uh hum playing in the snow they had big snow hills and the kids were playing on it .
so that was pretty cool .
and then remember you chose something there ?
a light up sword .
wow .
that was very helpful because remember what did what did i use it for when we were walking back to the car ?
uh hum so we would be safe and nobody would hit us with their car yeah so that was kind of great yeah .
so i held it out by the road right .
uh hum .
so that was helpful i'm trying to think of what else you and daddy went sledding this weekend too right that was something else that happened .
he told me some funny stories about that didn't you guy's crash or something ?
yeah .
tell her about that .
wow so was that fun or were you scared ?
not too bad .
you did get cold yeah i know .
mommy hasn't really gone sledding too much recently because i got wet everywhere and i got full of snow and i got cold .
i don't like being cold how about you ?
yeah so you got to go sledding recently and hm i'm trying to think of what else we have been up to hm well of course there was valentine's day .
oh on saturday or sunday rather remember we went shopping oh my goodness we went everywhere shopping do you remember that ?
and what did we decide in terms of at the mall if you did a great job at the mall then what ?
abraham lincoln ?
okay .
abraham lincoln .
now abraham is missing something .
hm .
yeah .
poor abraham needs what ?
you'll draw it okay .
you've forgotten though sometimes i do not know why because you've got two yourself right .
yeah .
so uh we went shopping yep and he was allowed to get ah what did you chose for your snack ?
are those his knees ?
oh his pockets to keep stuff in his pockets that's a good idea .
did you forget what you chose at the mall ?
let me give you a hint you go like this .
what could that be ?
ice cream mm .
yeah an ice cream cone .
because he did do a good job it's hard at the mall because we really literally went to like three malls we did a lot of shopping we didn't go inside of all of them .
but remember right before we went to the first mall you were not feeling well remember what you said to me ?
no i do you said i'm gonna ?
you said i'm gonna throw up .
you didn't though but you thought you were gonna in the car so we stopped right away and we had lunch because you weren't feeling very well in the car .
you told me actually something that happened one day when i was at work because daddy has been off work all week so you stayed home with daddy on monday and then there was something that happened in terms of your not feeling well do you remember that ?
no okay well i heard a story about how you threw up everywhere .
everywhere well not everywhere but a lot of places right ?
um hm .
we actually had couple of other interesting days because i had to go to seattle right .
so who took care of you when i went to seattle ?
um hm and who else ?
didn't somebody have to didn't have to go to somebody's house and stuff ?
you need a tissue i know .
i have one .
oh you do that's great .
hey boo .
what are these ?
how many fingers does he have ?
oh man he got three more .
he's been kind of sick .
blow go ahead and blow .
wow lots .
i know yuck ick you've got another one ?
she's a very helpful person go ahead .
yeah i don't know how you got sick .
but there was one night remember a couple a nights ago you woke up and said mommy mommy and what did you want to do in the middle of the night ?
did you want to stay in your own bed ?
how come ?
well you said in case you threw up right .
you wanted us to see that you were sick .
did you throw up in mommy and daddy's bed ?
that's what he said he didn't want to get his own bed messy right boo ?
just not in mine in mommy and daddy's bed .
there's been actually i had something that i wondered if helga would know much about and that is we've been watching this movie a lot .
right and then we actually checked it for a week out but then daddy forgot to return it well i kind of forgot too but i thought daddy was gonna do it and anyway so what happened we got it ?
it was overdue yeah so we got it for another week but you watched that pretty much almost every day but do you know what the name of it is ?
jumanji .
have you ever seen that movie ?
uh hum .
oh that's a great movie .
that's such a funny show oh that's an awesome sun that makes it for a very sunny day .
so what's your favorite part of jumanji ?
oops .
oops the crayons are falling out .
so what's your favorite part of jumanji boo ?
but he really didn't die right ?
she couldn't have died so what happened to her ?
she played dead .
i am trying to think of what my favorite part is hm i do not know .
i kind of like the end when everything gets sucked back up into the game that part's cool .
i can't remember what anything looked like .
you don't need it ?
you were telling the people at your school about your favorite animal that was in that movie .
you remember ?
well so which is your favorite animal ?
you liked the elephants .
it smooshes it which isn't really what would happen what would really happen ?
well think about it .
for .
yeah but instead he just gets kind of stuck in his car .
it's a very pretty ball isn't it i like it .
so what would you like to do boo you made an awesome picture of abraham lincoln .
what do you want to do next do you want to play with this little house thing ?
do you want more paper ?
okay .
george bush ?
oh okay you can draw that now sure .
he has short hair .
kind of brown i think i think just brown hair right ?
um hum .
maybe kind of brown or maybe gray .
sure you draw the head and i'll do the hair sure .
hope you like green does he have a green head maybe ?
pink on pink .
hum here we go here is his head and then he's got some brown .
i'll put the brown here on .
how's this color of brown is this one fine ?
how about this here's a brown ?
are you alright ?
that's probably pretty much it good ?
oh my goodness that's a funny part .
do you remember why mommy and daddy don't really like the president ?
oh what did he decide that we should do or that we should have that mommy and daddy don't think we should have ?
yes that's right .
why did he think so ?
um .
good question .
well i think he thought that there were some bad people in this country and so he thought that he should have a war with them but the bad people probably weren't gonna hurt us and they probably won't .
do you think that sounds good that he was going to try to save people from a mean guy ?
so we should draw him what kind of a face should we make him ?
scared ?
he might be scared because he might not be the president anymore we're gonna get a new one maybe maybe he's scared .
you think he is happy ?
because he's president now ?
that's a very big smile .
happy guy huh ?
now he lives in washington d c remember when you went to visit there ?
that was a good trip .
remember we saw uh .
i know i didn't go to washington d c but i did go to the other place .
new york city .
remember what did we all see together in new york city that was super super super cool ?
do you remember ?

i can't ?
well you just had it today for lunch .
where is the cheese sandwich ?
yeah it's probably got all broken up into tiny tiny pieces by now .
a long time ago at lunchtime right ?

you know i don't think doctor weist knows about the math class you're in what would you say about the math class what do you do guys do ?
oh my goodness really ?

uhh i understand .
now when you're done do you guys .
a hole in your head ?
you almost got a hole the other day .
in your head .
remember when you fell down the stairs ?
you didn't well that's good i thought you might .
thankfully you didn't .
still .
you just ripped your foot that was a real thing that happened .
well let's see it let's see how it's coming along here let's see it .
yeah see .
the socks are stuck on ?
see he did hurt his foot .
ouch .
yeah we set the remember we said we ran out of band aids we gotta get some on the way home .
so what is up with this how did that happen ?
oh no is it bleeding ?
it stopped ?
yeah it doesn't look good we need to put some like kind of ah medicine stuff on it and then we need to need to also you know um put a band aid on it .
i am just very surprised because there's nothing wrong with this foot .
so what's going on with this foot ?
what we are going to think it's going to be too stinky ?
you know what they say ?
looking good pal .
i think they look good when they're on .
really are your feet like so hot ?
this one is kind of hot actually .
okay we will put this one on sorry helga .
what do you think he is going to say back ?
what do you think doctor weist is going to say about all this ?
uh stinky .
uh do you think that's what he's going to say doctor weist ?
like if this is a phone and he's talking ?
i don't think your feet are really that stinky .
don't do that please those are germy don't do that they've got germs on them .
your parts that are scraped .
now you have a germy tongue .
smell your tongue you're so funny don't oh yeah yeah stinky okay that's enough .
let's find something else we can talk about that we have .
that is that is new information .
did you want to play a game in here quick ?
okay .
you're what ?
oh you wanna color ?
okay let's see here boo she's going to get the coloring stuff we'll continue our interview .
we're gonna what ?
what guy ?
oh you're gonna draw the president's house ?
the one who we what ?
with the wood cabin oh the wooden .
oh the wood cabin the log cabin abraham lincoln you're gonna draw his house ?
i see .
yeah because i guess because wood is brown right wood is probably brown ?
you wanna do it just like it was in the art class okay ?
so did you draw ?
yeah you were mentioning brown do you see any ?
yeah that's a pretty good color for this .
is it hold on it looks very is it sparkly ?
i wish you could see the picture he made today of the pizza parlor it was very cool .
oh yeah .
oh yeah it was what what was it about what was in the pizza parlor picture ?
and some fans and wheels .
and you know do you make the pizza's are they cooked inside the parlor ?
no .
you have to do what ?
i see you can just drives around and sells the pizza but you have to cook it at your house .
it's a really interesting picture .
so tell me about this picture you're making .
you wanna sit here want me to move ?
okay .
what are these things ?
uh hum .
and these are more logs right .
does he get to go inside the picture the president guy ?
yes .
hum .
white .
i think i'll go and sit in my own chair because i am falling off this one .
what's this part ?
oh so he can look outside of his house .
uh hm .
that's a good idea .
yeah i think that's the color you've been using yeah .
you're gonna use yellow for the guy .
i think when we saw you last it was right after presidents' day wasn't it ?
um hm .
and he had made remember matty pictures of president bush and president lincoln or something ?
washington maybe it was george washington you made .
that was what ?
you made the one that thought wars were good you mean bush our president now that was the one that thought wars were good .
i thought you were talking about lincoln .
yeah and lincoln he tried to he wasn't that excited about wars but there was a war when he was the president but he was the one remember lincoln who said no slave states .
no slave territories .
right .
so this is gonna be a great picture .
you know after we go home today after we gotta go find daddy and we gotta go vote for trying to get a new president .
you think that's a good idea where we can get a new one ?
yeah .
you're not old enough to vote but you can come with us .
you have to be eighteen .
how old are you ?
yeah not quite yet .
so what do you think if i gonna say should i vote for john kerry or john edwards ?
you think i should vote for john edwards ?
how come ?
does it sound like a better name ?
john edwards .
okay he's a younger man he's actually not that much older than me and daddy really .
oh there's the guy there's lincoln in there in his house cool .
oh what's this part of it ?
oh .
um hm you've got the color that's usually there .
so alright so edwards okay .
so hopefully when we get a new president then there won't be a war anymore hopefully we'll see .
that's the nose .
now when we go home you wanted to see if your gummie thing is done right ?
yeah .
how do you even make those gummy things anyway ?
you just stick red stuff in there and they become red ?
what becomes red ?
and then what do you with it how does it become different shapes ?
um hm .
the little plate thing and it come out into different shapes .
but what happens if they don't come out if they are just stuck in the container .
oh so if it is not done today we'll just wait until tomorrow .
okay that sounds not too bad .
little they're little gummy things so i see so you chose the color to make it red ?
i see that was the only thing left .
so what if there was a dinosaur that came to abraham lincoln's house .
sure .
he would probably what ?
devoid them ?
so you made this his house when he was the president so what if the dinosaurs come you'd say do you think he would avoid them or do you think he would destroy them ?
avoid them right .
now what would the president say you are not welcome here go back to your planet ?
did the dinosaurs get in i thought is the president oh my goodness what is the dinosaur doing ?
it ate the whole log cabin house .
abraham lincoln .
wow what kind of a face would he have now that his whole house got eaten ?
do you know how to even draw a sad face ?
wow oops i think we'll have to put them back in after you're done drawing okay ?
that's a nose right ?
well let's see i think a happy face goes like this right so a sad face just faces the other way .
that's a sad face you start at the bottom like a rainbow you know kind of like drawing a rainbow .
uh that's a good sad face .
ah i'm so sad a dinosaur ate my house .
what's that part ?
oh you are just putting your name in it .
m a t t .
and then we got some legs .
and a big foot .
anything else he's missing ?
what ?
yeah i think arms .
okay .
okay for abraham lincoln should i put his name on the top ?
should i put abraham lincoln say .
ate house ?
well that's the other side would be the ate house .
ate house we would actually say eaten house .
yeah eaten house .
eaten .
we would say we have eaten the house .
oh really ?
what if it was made out of candy ?
what if it was made out of candy then we would eat it ?
abraham lincoln's eaten house okay .
hum what did you draw it ?
like all on your own mouth i see sad .
are you feeling so sad ?
infinity ?
you wish you could have infinity what ?
infinity pieces of candy .
what would happen if you had that much candy do you think ?
yeah you would get a stomach ache .
so i have a funny idea .
we're almost done but i was thinking about we've been reading a lot of those jenny b jones books you know how you are going to have your party like that ?
do you wanna tell doctor weist the story quick about jenny b jones when she has the slumber party ?
no .
what's the other one we read recently ?

oh yeah yeah yeah that's when she wants to do to certain for for career day she wants to be a certain thing .

what were some of the funny things we had to do ?
i had to pull a pillow around yes .
what did you have to do lots of times ?
and then another thing that we kept having to do was remember flying around .
and we kept ah there was another one we kept running into too we kept having to do again and again what's the one with the animals remember naming the animals ?

the one we both had to do huh uh i can't remember what was another one we had to do ?
oh yeah yeah at the end of the game what do you have to do ?
but what is it what're you doing ?
oh .

touch the sky .
i remember another we used to have to do all the time too that was um go on all fours and pretend what ?
pretend that we were a cow yeah .
it was supposed to be a game for the county fair .
um hm .
so we had to go around and you had to do different things .
it was kind of good exercise wasn't it ?
hum .
so i'm trying to think what else we've been doing this week .
we went to the art museum that was a big deal .
yes .
what do you need money for ?
you mean when we leave ?
okay well we will go out that exit okay and i will let you choose a candy bar if i have money .
okay we'll look in my purse .
what kind of candy do you like any kind ?

see i don't because you know what did we just do before we came here ?
we stopped to go to the bathroom at a place but what did we get at that place for you ?
what you forget when you already just ate it ?
oh alright so that's what i am thinking about you had a cookie and then you are thinking about having candy too ?
what about your dinner ?
you still want dinner too .
do you know what's in the freezer i think that you have not eaten yet ?
your favorite macaroni and cheese you know the spiral noodles .

so i was thinking we went to the art museum and then that same day we went to buffalo to um go out to dinner or it was lunch remember and matty had something that he'd never had before .
remember what was in those those little won tons those things that you had on your plate and we did not tell you until afterwards of what you ate do you remember ?
when they had little pieces of shrimp ?
what'd you think about that ?
i think we should order you a big thing of shrimp now because you probably really like it now .
you didn't even know you ate shrimp .
oh okay .
what's the only kind of meat you like really ?
pretty much yeah .
and another one you eat too .
what's another thing you might eat in a sandwich ?
ham he'll eat ham and chicken that's pretty much it .
these are all the wheels .
now i have to admit i'm a little nervous if these are all wires is it safe to touch the paper ?
are you sure ?
i do not know i got a little little shocks from touching it .
you saw a movie that just had him in it recently .
what was it ?
do you remember what it's called ?
lion king one and a half .
hum and he can do anything to his arms .
you can twist up the waist very well let's see oh yeah he can like even dance .
who's that do you know who that is supposed to be ?
i think it this is supposed to be um his brother george .
george weesly .
yeah remember he played quidditch too .
we were just talking about harry potter in the bathroom how did you say it you said it perfectly how they say his name .
see you do it with an accent yeah .
do you know that a new harry potter movie's coming out this summer ?
yeah it's gonna be good we'll have to go see it .
maybe we should watch that for our movie tonight the one with the giant snake .

would do you think could happen to them ?
right but what could happen when they fall ?
get lost okay what else ?
they can get dirty right can you think of anything else ?
ruined that's kind of what i was thinking that the ends could break off the parts that you draw with you know ?
yeah .
do you want me to read the names of the colors they're kind of interesting names ?
they have kind of interesting names okay bring me the box please and we will put them back as we're done as we read them .

white with confetti glitter that's a good name .
gold red orange ah white red again yellow green hm interesting so green and yellow green let's see oh yeah there's a big difference there .
which one do you think looks more like grass ?

you're gonna make a grass picture now ?
turquoise blue this is called razzmatazz this is very interesting wild purple with ruby gold with ruby red glitter that's on here .
robins egg blue that's a very nice color .

that's a nice grass picture .
purple what .
oh great idea purple crickets i love that idea .
so you've got grass and purple crickets ?

i love it .
i'm trying to think of what else we might have in the summer that you could put in your picture .
a white house oh that white looks pretty good it works on the green paper very well .
speaking of houses we were going up the stairs and matty told me and this girl was there that the president was at our house right now remember that boo you told her the president of the united states was at our house .
so that's cool that's a white house so they lived by the .
is this their lawn ?
oh it's our house very cool .
okay it's gonna be a gold chimney .
hm what color do you think smoke would be ?
gray oh there's a lot of smoke coming out of that chimney .
you know another thing i'm a thinking about is helga probably doesn't know where we are planning to go for the summer trip remember we went to get information on it .
where are we going this summer ?
you don't like disney world do you ?
wow what do you wanna go do over there ?
they have swimming pool at disney world ?

oops that's gross don't do that please .
what else did you add to your summer picture you've got a chimney and a house and smoke coming out of the chimney and we got grass with crickets what else ?
anything else you can think of for the house or for the picture ?

we went to ?
niagara falls .
what'd we do at niagara falls ?
yeah yeah we walked around and looked at stuff that's true .
well you got something there that you liked very much and remember we kept consulting you what'd you pick up there that you kept looking at ?
well how'd we know where we were going ?
so what was it ?
um hm .
wow .
whole niagara falls yep so we saw one part and then we walked and then we went all over it ?
um hm .
we also did something else we never did before do you remember where we climbed ?
hum we climbed to the tower remember how we kind of climbed up to the higher part kind of like an observation tower and we saw over the falls ?
um hm .
oh that's the one you were talking about yeah .
so we did that and then the weekend before which was right after we saw helga the last time we went to pittsburgh .
and what'd you do there ?
did you swim ?
tell her about the big cool swimming pool .
oh cool .
um hm and you'd end up outside .
uh hm .
it was very interesting so we went swimming and then what else did we see the next day ?
dinosaurs yep at the dinosaur museum .
there was some kind of interesting part about by where they had the dinosaurs what'd you get to do ?
did you dig or you totally don't remember ?
they had a site where you could dig for dinosaur bones but only kids were allowed right ?
and what kind of tools did you need in order to dig ?
your hands ?
no .
one was like a little chisel and then .
and then what'd you do ?
that was really very cool .
and then that part was cool and then try to think about what else was interesting about that dinosaur museum do you remember anything else that was kind of cool in there ?
did they have tiny tiny dinosaurs .
giant dinosaurs .
they were they had a close relative of like a brachiosaurus remember how long that was and remember how we counted it out ?
yes .
what else was the coolest coolest dinosaur there ?
where there any meat eaters ?
didn't they have a tyran ?
tyranasauraus rex yeah that was very very cool .
see it seems like almost a long time ago since we went that was only about a week or two ago but i don't remember our trip very well either hum .
well that doesn't show up now does it .
so what else have we been doing ?
oh maybe we should her what happened to daddy and how you had to help daddy ?
um hm .
you helped him put his socks on ?
no ?
how did you help him when he got home from work ?
um hm .
um hm he and his daddy just laid down from the people you know he didn't expect his daddy to play like games with him or anything right you guys just laid on the couch .
yeah and how did we set up the couch so it would be very comfortable ?
um hm we set up the pillows and the hot um heating pad right ?
you know what i think he's feeling better today .
what were you thinking when you were just downstairs with him now ?
um hm yeah he seemed to be doing better .
so i didn't get to hear much about the musical today at school .
what was it for ?
oh can't really say all of them because there's a bunch ?
remember sarah thought that she was gonna supposed to sing in it ?
she wasn't right ?
maybe sarah has older brothers and sisters that are gonna be in it an she got confused or something you know i don't know .
oh so he wasn't in the play right ?
oh that's so funny .
so i'm trying to think of what else we did ?
oh you and your dad went to the land on saturday oh my goodness .
doctor weist would love to hear about what you did on the land .
you don't remember much ?
it's just so funny you can't even say it okay well ah i'll just give a hint it has to do with the word mud .
you do remember it .
okay well i was at work grading a paper so i do not know but it seems to me that he and jason had a giant mud fight .
oh my what's up with him he looks really weird hum .
so they they came home and weren't you full of mud ?
daddy said he couldn't even see your clothes you had so much mud on you .
you're almost done you just have to color that .
so .
we have a bunch of plans actually for coming up this weekend whose birthday party is you is it on saturday ?

you dropped it on that button and then all the money came out okay well thank you picking it up thank you very much .
so anyway max is supposed to have an army party .
but i am not sure that matty should go .
but what happens what might you get as a present ?
well maybe ah maybe we should just give it to a different kid .
no .
i do not know why he likes the army stuff though .
i saw him wearing a little army outfit again today .
i wondered if maybe his dad used to be in the army sometimes if you had your dad or something in the army or your mom then you don't think army stuff is bad i do not know .
well yeah it's bad if people die right i think then it's bad .
you're alright .

for two weeks .
well do you have school ?

aha .

he died .
see .
no .
it's not diarrhea .
he just took down his cage .
he took down his nest and he died very peacefully .
he sure did .
he took his nest down .
it's not something we smile about laura .
okay .
guess she doesn't wanna see him .
he didn't suffer .
no .
he was peaceful .
and he got himself ready to die laura .
he took his nest down and he knew he was dying and he got himself ready .
yes .
he knew .
he could feel inside .
a feeling in the air .
mhm .
we're not going to .
alright ?
yes .
come here .
you don't wanna see ?
okay .
he was very peaceful during and he took down his nest and he knew that he was dying and he was very peaceful .
i'm sorry .
okay laura .
you can .
you make her feel bad when she tries to help you and you don't let her help you .
i'm sorry honey .
i didn't wanna tell you this morning .
i didn't wanna ruin your school day .
died very late last night .
i went in to give him his lettuce leaf and found him dead .
and i felt very sad last night .
daddy and i felt very sad last night .
you're right to be sad .
you just wanna cry ?
i am feeling that .
that's one of the hard things about a pet .
you get to love it and .
we knew that he had to die .
i don't care .
you won't need to .
should i help you ?
can i help you some how ?
yes .
look .
no .
she shouldn't look at .
she doesn't wanna look at .
get off .
did i tell her that died ?
yes .
yes .
why shouldn't i have told her ?
she would've had to know laura .
well .
you do crying for no good reason at all plenty of times and we tell you we don't like the crying .
some thing dying is an alright reason to cry .
i didn't wanna tell you this morning .
thought it would be hard to go to school .
thought you'd wanna be next to mummy and have a hug .
okay .
no .
we love them all their life and then they die and we miss them .
there are all different ways of showing sadness .
and people show it by trying hard not to cry .
other people cry hard .
there are all different ways of expressing sadness .
doesn't feel like anything .
the body part of doesn't feel anything anymore .
doesn't hurt .
it's not hungry .
doesn't breath .
it doesn't speak .
yeah .
would be a lot of talking .
okay .
two gentle girls .
too many stories .
you know the worst thing of all would be to not feel sad .
because if you love somebody and we lose them and you don't feel sad that would be terrible .
if some thing that we loved died and we don't feel sadness that would be bad .
because we need to let that sadness come out of us .
but being alive means there's sad and unhappy things .
well .
had many happy times .

glad you ca called up .
i'm really quite confused .
oh .

i'm relieved to hear that .
i was wondering how you were gonna get the car in the house .
what does it mean ?
sure .
there're lots of little bugs running round on the ground .
what kind of buggy did you have in mind ?
real buggies ?
what're real ?
oh .

you don't know what it .
er .
maybe that's enough .
um .
i think you're just looking at my bathrobe .
it's alright if you don't understand because i'm a big grown up and i don't understand how you can be going nuts and driving someone bananas .
it just doesn't make sense to me at all .

yes .
i know what difficult means .
difficult .
oh good .
i'm glad we can can understand it .
i'm glad we can unders .
oh no .
no !
i don't believe it !
alright .

yes .
yes .

alright .
we could hear the tape recorder .
i have one important question to ask you .

did you know i love you ?
how did you know ?
because i'm your parent .
that's true .
what does it mean if i'm your parent ?
i had you ?
i made you .

can i do it all my myself ?
yeah right .
how do i get that sperm in there ?
you're right .
yeah .

alright .
you wanna hear what you said ?
there please .
this is an extremely important job .
i need to figure something out about these glasses of water .
see this glass of water .
how much water do i have in there ?
half .
okay .
half a cup of water in this blue glass .
would you pour this water in this brown glass please for me ?
okay .
how much water do i have in there ?
half .
do i have the same amount of water in the brown cup as i had in the blue cup ?
yes .
now would you pour this water in this plain cup for me ?
this big tall skinny cup .
oh .
look how much water i have in there .
how much water do i have ?
do i have the same as in the brown cup ?
i don't ?
how come ?
you mean it's more than half a cup o .
but wait a minute .
pour it back in the brown cup a minute .
it's a little more in which cup ?
in the glass cup ?
now do i have the same amount of water as i had ?
why not ?
it has more in the big skinny cup because it has a different shape bottom ?
but don't i have the same amount of water even if i put it in the other cup ?
how come ?
you poured it back in the plain cup er in the skinny cup .
mean it goes it fills more of the plain cup ?
i don't understand what you're trying to tell me .
i see .
i see .
now let's pour it in this .
alright .
pour it in that cup and see what you have .
now .
this cup and this cup are the same .
right ?
do i have the same amount of water as i had when i started in this blue cup ?
oh .
you're gonna pour it and see .
alright .
yes .
in the cups that are the same i have the same amount of water .
you gonna pour it back in the other cup ?
it's the same .
you'll see .
now .
pour that in the little blue cup .
do i have the same amount of water ?
no ?
how come ?
we'll see .
are you gonna put it back in the in the tall white cup .
that fills the cup all the way up .
the short now the short wide cup gets filled all the way up and the tall narrow cup gets filled all the way up .
you're pouring back and forth .
no .
are you all done ?
alright .
try it backwards and .
okay .
short wide into the taller identical cup .
do you have the same amount ?
pours back into the short white cup .
i see .
now i wanna ask you a very important question .
if this were chocolate milkshake which glass would you like to drink the milkshake out of ?
okay .
you pour it into the cup .
so that's the tall narrow cup .
why would you like your milkshake in that cup instead of any one of the other cups ?
i see .
but wouldn't it be the same amount of milkshake ?
i see .
it looks better .
you done with the water ?
okay .
oh .
you're gonna drink the water up .
that's a good idea !
that's a very fine idea .
okay .

i still didn't wash my hair .
they'll be back and i haven't washed my hair .
yeah .
i better not do that one .

does her grandmother have a dog ?
keith said he's going to send you a picture of trouble .

it has a tip .
mhm .
what are you writing ?
put the cover back on .
twist it .
may i try ?
here adam .
i'm afraid i don't have any juice but you may have a banana .
you may give robin a banana and ursula a banana if you like to .
yes .
what ?
what ?
i forgot to say that you could have a banana ?
i didn't .
i said adam you could have a banana and offer robin and ursula one would you ?
don't forget the cover adam over under the chair .
not very well .
robin would you give him a few pieces of paper .
sure .
in case you want to carry it with you .
you didn't put the top back on the yellow .
you hold this down .
take a test .
what kind of test ?
oh .
will you make a picture of me too ?
alright .
you'd love to be a banana monkey ?
what ?
do you want to use another color ?
don't forget the top .
look .
it's behind the crayons .
here's the red .
i'll blast it off for you .
what happened ?
is that the baby fish .
what's your favorite color ?
a spider .
a rainbow .
is it ?
a snail .
a shell .
it is ?
you find shells in the bottom of the sea .
you could .
you don't want a fish what ?
you could wear a suit to cover you all up .
to go under the water .
that's what divers do .
i saw a movie about it .
about men who lived under the sea for three months .
how could they ?
they didn't have enough air .
they took their air along with them in tanks they made there own air out of the water .
they went down and explored the bottom .
i could show you some pictures of that movie .
okay .
alright .
robin would you give him some more ?
do you want me to do it ?
adam let's take off one cover at a time alright ?
no one at a time .
it that the air tank ?
they're all covered in suits .
so they don't get wet and they have a plastic thing so even the head doesn't get wet .
it's round and you can see through it like a .
like a helmet but it covers the face so you wouldn't get wet .
no .
for going under water it doesn't have holes in it so you don't get wet .
you're making him all wet .
good .
here's a color .
what's base ?
oh .
something like gloves .
something like boots but like a suit that covers him everywhere .
they're already here .
yes .
they're up there by my purse .
good for you for putting all the tops on adam .
my you're hungry .
i might just save mine .
mhm .
i'm not hungry just now .
are you ?
really ?
can you make some fish under the water ?
here it is right under your knee .
it's still under your knee .
try again .
is that a test .
that's not a test .
you can take that out to play with .
you can surprise your mother .
she won't know what's in there .
would you like some more banana adam ?
open it up and take half .
i'll show you how much is half .
i don't think so .
you really think so .
let's see what else is in my bag .
you want to look at the little book .
no didn't you see them before ?
are you going to finish making yours ?
alright .
who's the teacher ?
do you know you can bend that mirror ?
how do you look bent ?
don't you like the mirror ?
let me see if it needs cleaning .

three legs ?
no i'm just using a handkerchief .
oh isn't that pretty .
what is that ?
is it an apple ?
is it something you eat ?
is it a hat ?
do i know anything like it ?
alright .
i give up .
isn't that pretty .
oh .
isn't it nice .
i don't like myself very much .
how do you like yourself ?

how did you open it when i wasn't in here ?
mrs ursula opened it ?
mr come on adam .
diandra see yourself in there ?
write a story for us .
adam why don't you write your name .
you're not a little what ?
she'll be surprised .
do you want to use the newspaper ?
i've never seen your name written like that .
where's the a ?
i only see your name one time .
all the other times your name is all wrong .
adam put your paper on the newspaper .
just use one piece at a time .
and you didn't tear it off properly .
mommy .
where are are you going ?
then you'll be here all by yourself .
would you give him a little piece ?
that not david .
that robin .
what're you making adam ?
have you finished with this one ?
oh no not yet .
i didn't have enough boxes .
it's a dollar sing .
adam what're you making ?
could you give us a piece of paper please ?
it could be the result of a fire but .
keep coloring on the back .
that's very nice .
that very nice .
did robin make that ?
why not ?
oh is that adam's name ?
let's bring everything over here .
what happened to all the crayons ?
invisible !
i don't think so .
we talked about it and you said that mommy could go .
i'll be back shortly .
leave paul here ?
well paul will probably cry and then ursula couldn't hear the tape recorder .
alright paul here's one for you .
adam you want to first look here to see all the different kinds of thing you can make ?
no that's the top .
that's the part .
these are the things that you build with see because they rest on one another .
no no .
adamy don't do that .
they aren't swords .
what ?
let's see you build it .
it seems to me you place these long ones on top of one another .
paul we might have to go upstairs hm ?
those are building blocks .
well this is paul's .
he wants to build .
they look like beds .
there are no written directions .
there's just building there .
and you can make your building just like it by just looking at it .
you don't have what ?
please let him have some dear .
adam let him have some please .
look behind you diandra .
i think i better take you out .
can you build something on there adam ?
there's something started .
can you find another piece like this adam ?
are there any more big ones ?
let him have some of the little ones adam .
you can have some too .
you use these .
put some little ones in between and then it stays better .
yes now you can put another long piece on .
yes .
careful it doesn't fall down .
now you do the other side .
why is it naughty ?
he can take some .
no he's not .
looks like a what ?
that's a rooftop .
here diandra .
let's give him a few more .
let's see if we can't make it stand up .
i guess that one's too small let's put a bigger one on .
did you go to school today ?
with who ?
you want to put that one on ?
what's the matter ?
your shoe is untied ?
good and then you can put a roof on .
oh yes .
what're you doing ?
that looks high enough adam .
are they both the same so you can put a roof on ?
i think this needs to be one higher .
no diandra you use those .
carefully .
very carefully .
what're you going to do with them ?
maybe you could make a floor .
look at your building and see .
oh we should make some steps .
that's a good idea .
it wouldn't be so hard to make steps .
what ?
oh yes .
you could have an open house and walk in .
then you don't need doors and windows but you do need steps .
i don't think so .
now where we live .
what ?
maybe this house is way out in the country .
are you going to have any furniture in the house ?
furniture .
who is going to sleep in the beds ?
me !
i'm too big .
alright .
adam do you know what he's saying ?
not higher than the roof ?
how could you sleep higher than the roof ?
i thought we're pretending i'm small .
it's a bunk bed .
is everything alright ?
i'm going upstairs because paul really is very cranky this afternoon alright ?
you didn't make a gate .
a fence .
you need two straight pieces .
and a lot of little pieces .
i think they have to be the double kind .
the father kind .
like that .
that's a good idea .
we'll do that next .
right on top .
oh that looks good .
shall we make a fence all around the house ?
okay .
now you'll be safe .
why don't move that over because that might not go over the .
the fence ?
thank you .
isn't that a pretty fence ?
mhm .
okay .
we'll fix that adam that's not too hard to fix .
not too hard .
here .
a mouse !
a mouse can't eat me .
i'll eat the mouse .
it is not .
did you see any pictures of the circus .
have you been to the circus ?
now we need one more side .
oh that's so pretty adam .
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on .
it doesn't need a floor .
does it need a roof ?
maybe it doesn't .
yes that's right and that could be the water .
you can pretend .
make another one and we'll have a race .
alright .
the boat knocked down a house .
let's put everything back first .
will you help diandra ?
i didn't bring the top .
i have my car just outside .
it doesn't take very long to get from here to the car .
yes it does .
it takes very long from harvard .
that's where you used to live .
i live near there .
i'm in the same place .
is that yours ?
does diandra have one too ?
did you finish yours already ?
are they all picked up ?
alright .
then maybe diandra can play with it next .
why don't you let diandra play with the windmill and we'll put this together ?
diandra's your mother !
alright .
be very careful .
submarine ?
bless you .
it should .
it's supposed to .
alright .
maybe it's a jet .
yes .
yes .
no .
but this is peace time .
peace time means there's no war .
yes .
make it go high .
let's see if there's something else to do on it .
good for you diandra .
this makes it fly straight i think .
oh that's good .
it made a loop .
oh yes .
i see .
what's that paul ?
no let him look at it .
it says .
i don't think there is one .
oh yes .
i don't think so .
adam close the door please .
thank you adam .

yeah a fox couldn't attack a sheep .
but a coyote could .
that's right .

what ?
what's a male dog ?
not even a real dog .
because it could fight back .
huh ?
yeah .
aha .
you're right .
yeah i thought you were going to cough your head off .
no that was just a figure of speech .
it would be funny if you did cough your head off .
because then your head would roll around .
yeah .
aha .
anything's possible .
but was it really that small ?
what do you think about going to texas for christmas abe ?
maybe we will .
who killed the old grey goose ?
how did they find it ?

i don't understand what's happening .
somebody tell me what's happening .
abe tell me the story .
you can tell me .
go ahead .
where was it ?
how did it get there ?
that's what i don't know .

oh i'll use some of abe's .
hm ?
i have a bowl .
where ?
you want a celebration ?
so you and daddy are going to have a party while i'm at the hospital having the baby ?
while i'm having the baby ?
oh .
here it is .
you sure are .
yeah ?
when ?
when she was first born ?
that's the umbilical cord after they cut it .
that's right .
that's medicine to prevent infection .
no the umbilical cord's soft .
you know when you get a cut and you get a scab on it ?
after the blood dries up it gets hard .
that's what the umbilical cord does too .
it's soft .
but after it gets cut it dries up and gets hard .
so the medicine isn't hard .
it's the cord that's hard .
what ?
remember the book we looked at the other day ?
how big do you think the baby is then ?
these days or when it was first growing ?
oh pretty big each day .
as father as amy is now or as father as she was when she was pregnant ?
abe .
i don't think you could have since it spilled .
i hope to someday .
aha .
not a medical doctor though .
would you like to be a medical doctor ?
why not ?
yep would you like me to ?
i have to go over there tonight and check out .
aha .
why thanks mom ?
i didn't give them to you .
no i'm not .
those are mine .
i'm gonna need them when i take the course again .
yeah i thought i'd be through with them by summer .
so you could use them then .
but my plans didn't work out .
so you'll have to wait an extra year .
no i was gonna give them to you this summer .
but now you'll have to wait until next summer .
i'm gonna need them next year .
i was using it to get some of your dressing .
are you going to be a paperboy someday abe ?
what ?
oh .
you should probably be a little older than five .
you'll probably have to be older then five to be a newspaper boy .
you did ?
you did what ?
what did you carve ?
what's the head ?
oh the top and the stem .
oh .
it doesn't have any seeds left in it either does it ?
oh .
aha .
abe what would you have done if the pumpkin had said ouch when you were carving it ?
what would you have done then ?
why would you get out of there ?
what's that ?
what ?
i'd have been surprised .
oh that's pretty good advice .
yes .
how did it get stuck ?
oh .
we can throw it out if you don't want it .
what are you making ?
aha so that looks like this is the roof right .
well i'm trying to think what was the last time we saw helga it was just before oh i think it was just before easter right ?
do you wanna tell her some of the different things you've been doing ?
i don't know what you've been doing oh my goodness how about i'll give you a hint aquarium .
what'd you say about going to the aquarium ?
what'd you say about going to the aquarium ?
wow did you go swim with them ?
what were they doing ?
hum what were the great whites doing .
swimming ?
what else did you and daddy do while you were there ?
you got something that you kind of like ?
at the aquarium ?
you remember ?
teeth were they real ?
how how'd you get that ?
oh you didn't take it out of his mouth .
that would be scary .
um hm they were fossilized so they seemed to be alright ?
ah so then what did you like during the time when grandma and grandpa were here ?
you forget .
well remember this is when i was on my trip right .
one day you told me about driving .
driving from where to where um i don't know you told me you drove the whole day all day long .
you like the marker ?
so maybe we should talk about something because you are not really remembering those days how about won't you tell her about the new game we've been playing it's a super fun game at our house .
hum .
watch this ah is it going through .
you know that's actually not so good for the marker .
because it can mush the tops see and it might not work anymore .
you think it will still work hopefully .
so ?
you made three ?
orange ?
i can't believe you're not going to tell her about the very cool game we've been playing at home the one you did not want to stop playing that you wanted to play when we get home tonight ?
i have to pretend to cook him so how do we play it what'd you need in order to play the game .
okay and ?
yeah and what else .
okay so what kinds of things did i pretend to cook you up to be .
you forget really .
yeah ?
look how big of a dog that is yeah that is a big one ?
it's yellow i think ?
and this is yellow but it kind of looks orangie in the middle doesn't it .
interesting .
now that's definitely yellow ?
so what did we what's our plan with this she is probably wondering why we brought this .
to get a snack okay .
is there money in there .
that's a lot of money in there are you gonna buy the whole machine .
it looks like looks like something .
you recognized it .
yeah .
the silly purse .
actually matty do you remember what was in this when we bought it .
a deck of cards .
you remember .
oh wow there's quite a lot of money in here .
wow ?
this one's not going to be very helpful for the machine though ?
how come ?
it's canadian .
i know there were only three did it go under the table you think .
well at some point ?
um well you know you were telling me yesterday about some of the things with the magic show maybe helga would like to hear about the magic show you set up ?
can i put that one in hum ?
wow ?
a bunch of toilet paper came out of his mouth that was very interesting .
it came out the color whichever colors you threw .
and then what happened ?
see that is interesting .
what about the animals you said something interesting with animals too ?
do you remember ?
well i think it was something like there was a lion and it turned into a snake ?
okay ?
a bird turned into a ferret ?
i know a bird turned into a ferret isn't that what you just said ?
yeah i don't know how that could happen hm .
so that was interesting thing that happened he didn't go to school though for two weeks .
wow that's a lot of them .
the first week was kind of interesting because i was at work daddy was at work and who watched you all week ?
what'd you actually do with lisa ?
i know one thing you did .
went to the picnic ?
picnic in the living room how'd you have picnic in the living room ?
invite some of your animal friends to come ?
yeah i know those are kind of a wet markers aren't they ?
that's why you're only using one at a time because it'd be a huge huge mess .
wow ?
you know we had kind of a weird this weekend because we kept trying to do different things remember matty and like everything kept getting changed like remember first we were going to go to splash lagoon but what happened ?
right so we couldn't go to splash lagoon there was no room and then we were gonna go to this children's festival thing but then what happened ?
do you remember when we went ?
um hm it was already over by the time we got there ?
oh my that's quite a splattering .
uh hum ?
so we didn't get to go to that what did we end up doing ?
hm remember roman roman ?
let's see oh my gosh that's a total splattering i think you're doing this kind of full of marker though ?
yeah because look at it's flying everywhere it's getting all over the table it's getting it on me you're getting it on helga ?
let's not splatter them quite so much now okay ?
yeah not so hard ?
yeah that would be the way not to do it .
okay ?
what happens when i say not to do something and if you do do it what happens ?
time out or ?
bed early so let's not splatter anymore okay ?
it totally looks like paint ?
well you know the same stuff that's in markers is just basically paint right .
it looks like you're painting your hands pretty well .
so i'm trying to think of what else ?
look at it's so many .
only three three big splatters ?
and then some other stuff too this is like a little kind of a little splatter one ?
this is a little splatter one .
i don't want you to do them .
so maybe you could talk about what you got for easter you got a lot of presents for easter i am very .
oh yeah you did that's helga's .
so what'd you get for easter hum ?
oh you're splattering uh oh .
please don't do that i already asked you not to do that .
i think we're going to have to have a rescheduling we're going to need to come back a different day ?
because you're not following the rules ?
okay we're going to come back and we'll do this next week ?
now we will have to go home and go to bed early because you were not listening when i told you not to do that ?
what do we usually do when we're in here ?
hm well the markers are not working out so well though you're having a hard time listening with the markers ?
you'll try crayons ?
okay .
crayons are better because they can't splatter like markers .
okay so maybe you know i also didn't really like it when you threw the markers all over the table how do you think we can deal with the markers now .
okay and then ?
you had a better idea in terms of crayons right .
okay so we'll put these away can you please get them from the table .
i said we're gonna talk about it when we leave here ?
okay please give these to her .
thank you ?
i wonder if helga noticed your new shoes ?
do you want to describe them to doctor weist because he will can never see them so what would you talk about your shoes ?
you don't know .
no i feel like if you are going to be here you need to try to do a good job and talk like you always do about the same things .
otherwise we might as well just go .
you do ?
do you wanna try to come back next week and we will do it again ?
i think that would be better okay .
okay .

oh .
yes i don't like a clock to wake me up but i don't mind monkeys and i don't mind a kittie .
does your puppy wake you up ?
you would .
i'll take them off .
we can make some flowers .
in your yard ?
did you plant them ?
can i see them from here ?
i'll see them when i go out .
no not like this one .
i just made this one up .
you want to make some too ?
oh is that your ?
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to take that .
do you go to school all day ?
in the morning too ?
i thought maybe you go in the morning and stay and have lunch there .
is that how it goes ?
does kris go home too ?
it's a funny flower .
isn't it ?
here's another one .
what happened to my flowers ?
oh no she's here .
she's upstairs talking to somebody .
must be a gun .
me too .
oh yes .
then we have to make a sprinkling can .
oh yes i can .
alright .
let's see first how big your wrist is .
here's one .
no .
well i can make .
no .
no i can make a hammer and a chair .
wait a minute .
i have to put this on you .
let's try .
you have to ask me when you want it off .
you're just going to keep it on ?
alright .
here's your watch .
now it can't pinch you .
what time is it ?
eight thirty .
that's it right there .
aren't you going to keep them on ?
i'm going to keep mine on .
it comes off .
you look very elegant .
let's put them away .
i'm going to keep my ring on too .
let's leave the flowers up alright ?
are there some books in there ?
do you want to look at them ?
what're you going to do with the pajamas ?
what does it look like ?
a banjo !
let's see where it's going to fit .
doesn't your mother have one of these ?
guess .
no .
guess again .
i guess this is going to fit here .
try again .
we're going to need some crackers and a bowl .
do you want to ask your mother for that ?
a small bowl .
let's put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here .
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happens .
what did it make ?
it's a grinder .
it grinds them up .
lots of what ?
you can watch it come out here .
cracker crumbs .
you could put them back through again .
a what ?
a grain thrower ?
yes or else you could ask your mother if there is anything else she wants ground up .
it comes out like a waterfall .
i think maybe that's the last time .
watch your fingers .
what did you say sugar ?
yes that's the one .
sure and sheep too .
go slow .
grain fall ?
i think maybe that's enough .
they do .
they taste salty and delicious .
brush yourself off .
let's see if we can rescue some of this alright ?
that means you can grind this up again .
that's a good idea .
we'll just pick it up with the paper .
look inside and see how you think it works .
where does it push it ?
what way ?
where does the grain go when you push it ?
and then ?
mm .
you could make some bread with that .
you make bread out of grain .
oh let's take a bigger piece .
no .
careful .
you forgot something .
it'll taste like roast beef .
mm chicken .
what does yours taste like ?
chocolate !
let's make a little funnel .
pour it right in .
cheese .
grapes .
careful .
watch .
well look what happens here .
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there ?
what do you think it does here ?
how come it gets so small ?
what do you think it will be like ?
orange juice .
wait adam .
now don't forget to put the bowl back .
frost .
what's it like ?
there isn't any .
stand up and we'll clean it all off again .
alright but first i have to get it all collected .
wait for me .
don't go without me .
it's all gone .
alright .
water .
mine tastes like pepsi cola .
raspberries .
it changes grain into anything you want right ?
can you make me some strawberries ?
why do you have to wait till it gets older ?
what kind of things do you eat that are older ?
water's older ?
that's right .
only it gets less every time .
oh that's alright .
you can .
we can use the flower .
who's coming down ?
with the what ?
what did you call it ?
the grain what ?
alright .
well let's leave it up alright ?
i don't know if i have anything else .
maybe you'll have to show me some things alright ?
what do you think ?
you better put those back .
the pajamas aren't to play with .
guess .
what do you think ?
maybe .
i do .
cherries .
maybe i could have a drink but i can't stay for supper .
no .
why not ?
we forgot to show your mother the rings .
yes .
alright .
well i'll take one and you take two how's that ?
what did we forget ?
oh .
yes .
shall i get out the pipe cleaners ?
yes .
it would grind the stick up .
yeah but then you couldn't eat the grain anymore .
that's right because it'll be mixed with stick .
i'll try .
no thank you .
that's a good idea .
you make a chain .
a chain of flowers .
yes it's very old fashioned .
old fashioned glasses ?
shall we do that after the telescope ?
why don't you bake some bread ?
here's your telescope .
here diandra .
yes .
i'm making them .
oh thank you .
i'm sorry .
that i didn't bring you down anything to eat .
well we had all those fruits strawberries and cherries remember ?
oh my goodness .
now i don't have to get any birthday presents .
you do ?
what time is it ?
oh yes what shall i do with it ?
oh it's good .
no thank you .
if you want to but i don't want any more .
what do you think that was ?
maybe it was a police car .
how do you know how cows eat ?
how do you know how cows eat ?
no thank you .
say no thank you .
adam .
just a minute .
where shall we put this ?
you had something to eat .
did you tell her what you had in there ?
buds ?
oh it's a rosebud i guess .
yes .
would he be taller than you if you trade chairs ?
just a minute .
alright .
would you like to bring your chair over here ?
have you told her that you're graduating from nursery school ?
his robe .
who made the hats ?
oh i didn't even know i was supposed to make your hat .
well i saw them in her office when i took the robe in .
let's take the biggest thing first .
oh is that the way you know that's rubber ?
that was very nice of you adam .
i wouldn't be so sure .
let me open it .
is there a trick to opening this ?
good .
try it on paper .
does it work ?
it's the stamp pad .
we may have to put another drop of ink on there .
maybe a drop of water would do .
just one drop adam .
what ?
one fill ?
you don't need much so you ?
it won't work if you put too much on there .
one more drop .
what is that ?
maybe we have to use paint .
it's too wet isn't it ?
that must be paper to print on .
you can see the outline of it .
you could print it right in the book .
yes it is isn't it ?
yes you can even take them apart and print them .
one what ?
are those letters or numbers ?
can you spell your name ?
diandra he asked you not to touch them .
stop draw ?
alright draw stop .
stop draw .
diandra don't say stupid .
that's not nice to say .
he said what ?
well what does that mean ?
i didn't hear you say thank you .
a monster magnet .
it does doesn't it ?
why do you think it sticks ?
it's the most what ?
oh it's glue .
is that why it's sticking ?
it's not a magnet after all ?
it's not ?
it's not coming out ?
i don't think it really needs water .
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan .
no no this probably needs some more ink .
pen ink .
stamp ink .
that's not really ink .
that's the water that's mixed in with ink .
no i don't think you need water dear .
on the pad yes .
adam why don't you let them play with it ?
come on boys let's go upstairs .
i don't want a cat .
i've got a dog .
i don't want to have a dog .
my dog is outside .
these are mexican jumping beans .
he can help too .
it's right underneath the ink .
no i guess not .
isn't that nice adam .
very good adam .
can you tie your shoes ?
look in the bag .
i can feel mine jump when i hold mine in my hand .
what ?
yes i see .
without what ?
my arm is too big .
let me put it on you .
how can you get out ?
some more ?
you haven't finished playing with these .
are you sure you want something else ?
alright .
what did you find adam ?
now adam you better find yourself a a target .
you could use this for a target .
it's a dart .
aim for the target .
dart .
somebody what ?
you missed .
i never what ?
won't get it .
be careful .
i have an idea what you said .
i won't tell you .
it's a secret .
you missed the target .
no .
you almost got it .
what're you doing that for ?
are you his admirer ?
why don't you take that one out ?
you only had two .
here it is on the chair .
is that it on the chair ?
what ?
shoot at yourself ?
i wouldn't do that .
that could be dangerous .
no don't point it toward anyone .
why don't you do it over here ?
hit on the black .
almost .
two more darts .
well no .
let's look at your gun .
careful adam .
yes .
alright .
important to who ?
why don't you stick to one thing ?
only the one thing yes .
that's right .
she wants so much toys .
what will i play with when i go home ?
alright .
you have to take care of what ?
to do what ?
stand up .
what're you supposed to be ?
well let's let paul keep one .
do you have one diandra ?
yes .
just like a target shall be ?
is that what you said ?
you're aiming some place ?
a mexican day .
yes he can keep it .
that's right .
what ?
what's wrong paul ?
why ?
a what ?
no what could you put the cans on ?
a record phone ?
you mean the record player ?
maybe i can help you fasten it .
i don't think so .
no just on the door .
no dear on the door .
it's easier for mommy to keep up with with the door .
let's have the door for the special place for the darts .
that's the what ?
who makes the rodger gun ?
you only call it what ?
a rodger gun .
i don't feel like reaching way up there .
am i that tall ?
am i that tall ?
mommy .
aha .
see ?
are you going to be tall enough ?
promise not to do it again ?
i still can't reach it .
i'm afraid that won't be sufficient .
did it ?
good .
it's not up there by glue .
no .
she said no just like i said no .
no .
it works like a plunger .
no it's not a magnet .
why do you think it sticks ?
that's not the reason .
see if you can find out why .
it's not glue .
it has air .
i surely don't .
what do you think happens when i push down ?
yes just like a plunger that's right .
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there ?
maybe he could keep two .
can you tell me what makes that stick ?
i don't talk to you like that .
it wouldn't stick would it ?
why ?
the what ?
the dodge ?
what is the dodge ?
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun a rodger gun .
i don't know that i've heard of anybody with rodger as a last name .
you didn't hit her ?
are you sure ?
what ?
that's his nursery school teacher .
how many do you have ?
get on the other side honey .
you get on this side diandra .
close the door diandra .
a mule .
that's what the expression is .
it's something you say to .
yes you say it to a person to help explain something or add color to what you're saying .
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target .
oh is that why you missed ?
why ?
you don't wanna go and dance ?
you don't wanna go and dance ?
oh you'll be alright by that time huh ?

although it is true it's nice to have this light come from behind .
it is not is isn't .
you don't like my explanation ?
easier on my eyes right .
but was my explanation really a bad explanation .
no but not whether my idea was a bad idea .

did you think that was really wrong ?
what was the real reason that i did it ?
okay thank you ?
where do you have to put your legs up ?

well maybe they're for grandpa and grandma ?
i'm not sure .
i want to go outside and see the witches .
what ?
what's so fare about that ?
yes ?

so that the part that's fare for me is that i don't have to do too much .
and what's the part that's fare for you ?
oh you get to do some .
aha ?
i'm falling .
is that a good deal for both of us do you think .
okay but i thought you were going to talk about another problem you and i have ?
you forgot about the other problem ?
what is it ?
what is that other problem ?
it had to do with the telephone .
yeah there was a problem with the telephone ?
upstairs in my room ?

there was a little problem we had ?
what was it ?
and you hit marky and so what's the problem .
and what other problem was there ?
what ?
no what was bad about it ?
yeah and what else ?
and what else .
and you still haven't apologized to your grandfather ?
so there are three bad things .
first that you hit marky .
okay four count them .
to marky you didn't apologize to marky .
okay and then third .
yeah .
and four ?
no that wasn't that's not something wrong ?
going to your room is a punishment it's not something you did wrong ?
okay you want me to tell you what the fourth is .
you didn't apologize to grandpa for not talking to him .
you still haven't done that you could do that still .
no he didn't do that ?
and there's one more of the thing that you did that was wrong .
is that you made it so your father couldn't talk to grandpa .
five things ?
okay now which of those can we fix .
of those five there is one that we can still fix .
daddy ?
okay .
two of them you fix one of them right now ?
yeah ?
okay what about the other one .

which one .
what do you mean maybe today but really tomorrow ?
ow my foot is falling ?
you promise you will do it tomorrow ?
promise ?
okay and what other promise did you make for me tonight ?
no no you made another promise to me earlier tonight what was it ?
it had to do with the lego blocks ?
what was the promise ?
no it had nothing to do with that .
you made me a promise remember the little lego blocks ?
you made a promise to your father ?
okay did you do it ?
aha and are they all fixed and put back ?
do you know what happened ?
marky took them together apart again ?
okay ?
no no your promise is that you're going to get those blocks back ?
that's your promise .
you understand what a promise is .
well that's another problem ?
now remember what happens if you don't fulfill your promise ?
what's supposed to happen ?
okay so is that ready are we ready for that ?
jump over ?
okay then after do you promise to put the blocks back together ?
yeah promise promise .
do you promise too ?

so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter eaters don't have any meat ?
ross that can't be right ?
that doesn't make sense .
all animals have meat are full with meat .
meat eater means they eat meat .
dad ?
yes marky just a minute .
what is that ?
bologna and um mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not marky .
oh .
it's not butter !
is that butter ?
no ?
they're recording .
that's okay ?
um ross it doesn't make any sense ?
to say that that the plant eaters don't have any meat ?
is this butter ?
because their bodies are made of meat .
your body is made of meat ?
only if you eat meat .
you have meat in it ?
yeah you have meat in your body .
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat .
you see you gotta understand something okay ?
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body .
muscles ?
muscles muscles are meat .
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce .
that's not meat is it ?
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen .
no it'll go no your going to make apple sauce arms .
no .
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in case you want seconds or thirds .

that would be funny wouldn't it ?
those are just different kinds of bicycles and then see they've got these little shields and so that helps make them to be able to go faster .
and this has three wheels and the guy leans back and it's very little air resistance so it can go real fast .
it can go faster than most bicycle can go .
but it's hard .
you have to lie down and pedal .
that would be really hard i think .
and there's another one .
see it's got that little shield and you're inside some plastic and that makes it easier to go a lot faster .
that's a funny bike that's got a small wheel and a big wheel .
it's not a wheelchair but he sure does look strange on it doesn't it ?
and he has uh that's just a funny looking bicycle .
that's the same bicycle looked at from a different angle .

small front wheel .

okay here .
alright .
let me show you turn it .
see the way i'm holding it ?
see and just turn it in your fingers that's right good that's very good .
um you can try .

oh then it came out .
look at this .

oh okay .
okay is there something wrong with the engine ?
oh .
what's the matter with it ?
oh .
okay why don't .
here .
that's right .
okay i think if you use both hands it'll be easier use one hand to hold .
okay that's right .
go ahead .
oh you know you may have to use one hand to hold the wheel and one hand to work the screw driver okay .
helen ?
do you think you'd like me to read the story to you ?
would you like to stop and read the story ?
no ?
you like this ?
you sure ?

would you like to play store ?
or something like that ?
we can .
okay do you wanna do you wanna put the car back together and play store ?
okay .
okay put it put it in here .
wait a minute .
there .
okay now i think you can screw that back in .
turn it the other way .
turn it .
that's right .
yeah .
you turn it in one direction when you want to take the screw out .
and you turn it in the other direction when you want to put it in .
that would take it out helen .
turn it the other way to put it in .
okay that's good .
that's very good .
you're doing a good job .
well you have to learn how to turn it between your fingers .
that's good .
that's very good .
that's very good .
i know .
just relax .
see ?
see and in fact if you use two hands it might be a little bit easier for you .
should .
let's try to put another wheel in .
okay ?
alright .
okay alright .
i'll hold the car for you and you get a screw that's right .
put it in and in fact you know what might be a little bit easier to begin with ?
turn it with your hand first .
that's right .
and then when you have to tighten it you can use a screw driver .
alright .
you can .
now put the screw driver in .
okay that's right .
and tighten it .
tighten it .
good .
that's good .
that one ?
whoops ?
something fell out here .

did i say that ?
well maybe i did .
i don't think i did i think ross ?
i said .
that's very good ross .
so this idea of main reason is is something that he sort of inferred .
oh maybe i did say that was was the main reason .
yeah i guess i did ?
okay i said that was the main reason and ross repeated it ?
you're right ross i said it ?
she is a darling mommy shaving her darling legs .
in my knowledge i don't know .
what does knowledge mean ross ?
you were about to tell us .
don't stop now ?
not in your mind ?
in your mind knowledge means whether it's in your mind ?
if it's not in your mind then it's not in your knowledge ?
right .
except for feeling those aren't knowledge .
if you having feelings in your mind or ideas ideas well if you have feelings in your mind those aren't knowledge those are feelings ?
and then when they say .
use your noggin .
they don't really mean that they mean your knowledge .
how do you know that's the bone ?
how did you know it was the bone ross ?
because i noticed it before you did right ?
um and he's right it is a kind of a little bone end onto the bone on the end of the sword ?
here it is ross ?
what do you mean ?
play an ice cube .

you didn't really want a real cat did you .
what else ross ?
what did you want to say about a story ?

although he might not have thought realized how funny it was .
that means the last one ?
yeah i will .
but i can't come right now .
right .
which was ross and icey .
right actually though what but what interests me about that was the sort of he ross has developed sort of a bit marky talk dialect which is .
he wants you he loves you .
he repeats things for mark to make sure that mark understands .
yeah it's sort of ?
he doesn't use big sentences with mark uses nice clear little sentences ?
you know mark said roshie to ross because ross says roshie to mark in that baby talk .
yeah right my name is roshie right .
you're full huh .
