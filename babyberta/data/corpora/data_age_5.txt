you're a little scared .
mamma is going to be with you .
i'm a little scared when i go to the hospital too .
and everybody tells you what they're going to do .

no that arm band is just part of this .
it's going to be a little bracelet .
we'll take it off after we go home ?
you want to keep it on forever ?
hey how about taking your boots off ?

and then how about taking your tummy bothering you ?
okay .
you really didn't like that prick in your finger did you ?
oh my goodness .
just get ready .
because doctor strom is going to say !
where is paul parsons ?
i don't know .
maybe when you grow up you'll be able to wear your own jammies in the hospital ?
maybe when you are all grown up you won't have to wear hospital jammies ?
when you come to the hospital maybe they'll change ?
things do change in the hospital .
now this goes ?
this says rodeo .

no .
that thing tickles under your arms ?
you're going to go to sleep ?
and then you won't feel it tickle under your arms ?
leave your undershirt on .
aha !
you hate that thing ?
you'd like to wear your own jammies wouldn't you ?
that would be better .
i'd like it if you could wear your own jammies too ?
they probably would because all the ones in the hospital look like this ?
they're more like your night shirt .
see they're not really like uh jammies ?
they're more like a night shirt kind of thing .
huh .
yeah i think i that little boy downstairs i think is going to have his tubes fixed today ?

sopo .
what are you talking about sopo ?
there's no soap so why don't we wait and wash them when !
well that's true .
aha .
aha ?
it looks like a very special kind of bulb .
with you !
i can go everywhere except for in that room because doctor strom will be in there .
you'll be sleeping ?
but whenever you're awake ?
i can be with you !
would you do remember if you wake up in there .
if you wake up in there tell me if there's a big big light in the ceiling !
no brighter !
why why not .
you got a cut in your neck !
went to children's with you today right .

i bet daddy's taking jessie to the baby sitter and going in the car ?
no you better not .
in a little while when doctor strom gets his flat tire fixed he's going to come in and listen to your heart and probably look at your ears like he always does right .
he always wants to see your ears .
not on saturdays he doesn't look in your ears .
not on sundays ?
but on monday he does ?

this is kind of an old hospital ?
but it has nice doctors and nice nurses .
huh .
what are you scared of ?
what do you feel scared about ?
you just don't know ?
you just feel a little bit nervous in your tummy .
well you know what ?
that's why i'm here ?
because i wouldn't want you to be sitting here feeling scared without me to be right here right ?
that would be sort of sad .
that's why mommies get to come ?
to stay with their children .
and for daddy to come .
or both of us could come ?
why soon we'll all be done and we'll go home .
and you won't feel scared any more ?
will you .

it was fine .
it went just fine .
no right down the street .
just a couple of buildings down was my hospital .
too loose ?
or we can cut it off when we go home ?

where all of those places are that said no parking ?
pretty soon we'll walk right out the front door .
they're all waiting i guess ?
we were lucky we were first right ?
it's a bed .
and it has sides because sometimes the medicine makes you kind of jumpy and wiggly .
and these beds are so little .

oh i see we had a misunderstanding i was just supposed to get water out of the bathtub .
okay here's some more money if i can have some more seeds please .
okay alright we'll see how this goes okay ?
now let's just say i filled up my whole backyard with these trees .
oh yum can i i'll call you again .
hello .
this is working great now .
great i just have a little wonder of a thing i'm wondering about .
well i'm wondering about where he sleeps .
he does ?
does he get cold at night ?
he just lays outside .
i don't need any giant blankets ?
okay alright .
um let's see um he's a little lonely .
you got another brontosaurus for him ?
and they'll be friends .
okay thanks .
what ?
dinosaurs two they're getting ?
oh okay okay so you're announcing it to the store .
ah um is is this the one should i buy him ?
oh that wouldn't be so good with my brontosaurus .
okay i don't have any more money though i gave you all my money .
ah cool alright i'll pay you then .
one dollar is actually four quarters here's a dollar .
okay anything i need to know that's important about him in order to take care of him ?
nothing in particular where does he sleep ?
really nothing i need to worry about ?
you sure ?
can't they get anything ?
alright thank you .
um hm .
you wanna keep at least one or two of those quarters ?
what're you going to buy with them ?
just keep them ?
you just wanna keep them in case you need money later ?
one or two we'll talk about it after we leave .
okay .
you are you pestering me ?
didn't i say we can talk about it when we leave ?
okay let me have two back .
you want me to keep them all in there for the game ?
okay alright .
so i was thinking maybe we could do something else besides besides this game because i wanted you to be able to tell helga about your birthday and graduation and all these things so which one do you wanna start with birthday ?
okay tell her about your birthday .
well his birthday .
after the game oh but we won't have time .
just gotta i just gotta just buy this last one .
okay and then we'll talk about your birthday ?
two more quarters i gotta pay you more ?
all the money okay ?
alright we'll play this for just a few more minutes and then .
oh my goodness you mean you're keeping that ?
you don't have any pockets though right ?
oh okay we'll see about that okay alright .
so here are the triceratops home .
and now they're meeting each other .
they seem like they're getting along pretty well .
hi my name is joe my name is joe too .
they're both named joe .
i can't believe it amazing okay .
yes except last night they kept me up .
i don't know why i thought they were happy with the trees .
with having um you know a nice place to sleep .
but they were so loud .
the neighbors complained .
what would you recommend ?
you thought that what ?
so why were they loud ?
oh so maybe i should get a different kind of pet .
really well how do other people deal with the noise ?
they don't the noise doesn't bother them ?
oh do you think i should move maybe ?
no no take them with me and we'll move out to the country where there's no people living by us so we won't bother anybody .
okay .
do you sell houses ?
do you sell new houses ?
okay because i think that would be good because my neighbors are really angry and they were just loud all night long .
but you're right that's just how dinosaurs are .
do you sell do you sell things to cover their mouths so they don't roar ?
okay okay so like this will this help ?
is that how i should do it and tie them on will that keep them quiet ?
hum that doesn't fit at all .
hum maybe we could can he go in will it help if his mouth is inside this ?
ah it seems hopeless i think i'm gonna have to move to the country i think that's a better idea because they're just gonna loud i think .

a real donkey ?
no .
oh okay .
what'd you got to do ?
a real tail ?
yes and how do you know do you just walk right up and put it right on there that doesn't sound very hard ?

she probably doesn't know about a pinata either what's what'd you do with a pinata ?
you hit what ?
what i can't even hear a word you're saying ?
i can't even hear you why don't you speak out loud ?
why ?
it's hard to explain .
that you hit well it was a rainbow and that's because it was care bears so it was rainbow shaped and then you used what ?
yeah and then what happens once you hit it and it falls ?
oh there's candy yummy .
did you eat it all ?
other people scrambled to get all the candy that they can and they put it in a little bag right ?
and who ended up with the most candy ?
yeah you kept just grabbing it and he ended up with a bunch of it so .

very interesting maybe your were right and i was wrong .
who do you think is really right let's go listen ?
we went back and listened to the tape recorder and we couldn't hear the difference it was sort of mushy .

that's not really wood that's sort of foamy brick .
it's called foaming brick .
foaming brick ?
no no that's the horseradish .
that's the bitter herb .

and then we'll play with the store okay ?
now where would you like to sit ?
would you like to sit in the chair or would you like to sit on the uh .
on the bottom there ?
maybe you want to move this chair a little bit closer in here .
okay ?
cause they like they want to have you on this little mat here okay ?
move your chair on the mat .
oh okay .
okay n .
can you smooth the mat out a little bit now ?
there .
there .

there we go .
now what is this book ?
i've never seen this book before .
what does it say ?
no things in that box .
just the book .
this .
in that box .
that was the only thing in that box was that book .
okay pull it down .
there's nothing in it .
well what does that book say ?
great .
ch chase .
ch chase .
that's right .
shall we read this book ?
oh this is a picture book .
no .
there's a little lady taking her cat along on a buggy ride .
can you tell me what's in this look ?
oh now what happened ?
what happened here ?
yes .
i don't know .
but the lady's very upset .
i yes .
that's her baby cat .
where's the cat here ?
what is he doing ?
yes .
and so what does she do ?
that's right .
and what does the policeman do ?
right .
but now they've got to try to catch him right ?
right there ?
mhm .
look at the look on that cat's face .
i guess that's a big pipe .
a cannon ?
yes .
it could be a big cannon .
looks like it .
right .
and where's the cat going now ?
the policeman came through and what happened to the policeman ?
he fell down .
aha .
i don't think so it doesn't look like it does it ?
and there goes .
yeah .
no .
that's just the sky .
this is the river .
where ?
yeah .
now what's happening ?
yeah .
the policeman tried to help her get out of the pipe .
or the cannon .
and then they both fell again .
what happened to her hat ?
yeah .
you tell me .
okay .
the policeman and the lady fell in the river head first .
oh what are they doing ?
i don't know .
does it look deep ?
a little .
about half way up .
what would you do if you fell in the river like that ?
oh really ?
oh i see .
and then climb up there ?
what's the cat doing ?
they climb back through the pipe .
and then the little boy gets the cat .
and he puts it on top of the policeman's head .
do you think he did that on purpose ?
do you think so ?
look .
i don't know .
she's scolding him .
that lady is scolding her little boy .
so maybe he did do it on purpose huh ?
i think so .
what do you think ?
i don't really know but i think so .
now what happens ?
i don't think that's the little boy .
what does the little boy have on his shirt ?
yeah .
that's the policeman climbing the tree .
what's the little boy doing here ?
yes .
that isn't very nice is it ?
well he's sticking his tongue out at the policeman or the cat .
i don't know which .
maybe the little boy doesn't like the cat .
what do you think ?
mhm .
cause he's got the badge on .
see ?
his hat .
he lost his hat .
remember ?
in the river i think .
yeah .
that's a pretty high tree isn't it ?
mhm .
what ?
she scolding .
what'd you say ?
she's what ?
yeah .
in the carriage .
do you like that page ?
head first .
why do you like that one ?
well it can not be deeper than their waist .
you're in deeper than that in the pool .
cause your feet don't even come to the top when you stand on your head right ?
so you could swim in that couldn't you ?
in that river .
mhm .
what're you looking at ?
okay so did you like .
oh wait .
we've missed the last page of the story .
they all went home .
and now they're ah both in the carriage .
did you like that story ?
hm ?
i know .
we don't read very many picture storys .
do we ?
well um would you like to play with the other thing in that box ?
well she's she went out of the room .
here we'll put .
can you put this back in the box ?
i don't know .
can you get the other thing from the box ?
i don't know .
why don't you sit over here frank ?
why don't you sit over here ?
honey sit over here .
please .
come on .
cause i want you facing the other way .
yeah .
do does this remind you of a truck which you used to have once ?
long time ago .
what did you do with those things ?
mhm .
do whatever you want .
there .
why don't .
do you wanna take it all the way apart and see if we can put it back together again ?
okay then .
well that should .
let's see .
how do we figure this out ?
oh .
think we can get this back together if we take it all apart ?
remember where the things was .
look at all those things in there .
i see .
is that the motor ?
i guess it is .
you have to take this thing off .
the hood .
that's the trunk .
i bet that's what that other screw went to .
that red screw .
that was out .
remember ?
i know .
but what is that called ?
member when you when we got a flat tire the other night ?
that's why that tire is in there so that when you have a flat tire you can change to a new tire .
oh .
well .
yeah .
wanna take all the wheels off ?
i think you're turning it the wrong way .
here .
you gotta use the uh .
what's this ?
yeah .
i don't know .
there .
you already had it unscrewed .
try that one .
i don't know either .
well we'll try .
you wanna unscrew them ?
what if we can not ?
i don't know .
we just have to do the best we can .
i think we can figure it out .
what did you see at the fire station today ?
did uh did they go out on a fire while you were there ?
oh were there firemen there ?
andrea was afraid ?
ah .
what else is there to take apart ?
do you think we'll ever get this back together ?
here could i use the screw driver ?
you think we'll ever get this back together ?
okay .
huh ?
no i don't think so .
it's just .
well i don't know .
it doesn't go through there .
oh i know .
cause you know why ?
cause this has to go on first .
see ?
member ?
okay ?
now okay .
so what did andrea do when she got scared ?
mm .
did just mr f and mrs k go with you ?
yeah .
no .
was josh at school today ?
oh he did .
ava ?
okay now what're we gonna do next ?
do the sides .
huh ?
there .
that's it .
no because then the wheel fits into there huh ?
i think so .
maybe the other .
oh .
you know what ?
we have to screw this on to it .
like that .
you have to put this in .
see ?
and then it'll stay .
now you screw this .
yeah .
okay now you do this side .
i hope we didn't forget anything .
now .
now we have to put another one in here like this .
see ?
and then you need a what ?
a wheel ?
there .
okay .
now why did josh put the milk on his hair ?
oh .
i think it goes the other way .
yeah .
who's somebody ?
oh ava .
where's ava from ?
i don't think this fits .
let's see .
maybe we need a bigger .
yeah we need a bigger one .
there see if that fits .
yep i think that fits don't you ?
okay whoops !
oop .
now this side .
where's some ones that fit this ?
what color were they ?
we need that square thing first .
no that one didn't fit .
remember ?
is there another one ?
another color ?
how bout that yellow one ?
yeah .
but there should be another yellow one .
oh there it is underneath there .
okay .
okay do you know where to put that ?
that's right .
oh two more .
well one can go there .
i don't know .
we have to see what we're left with .
can i put this wheel on ?
oh .
okay .
that was the motor .
so that would go in the front of the car .
that went in here but was there something else that went with it ?
no ?
i guess that just went right there .
suppose that .
you suppose there's something under here that we're supposed to do ?
oh i see now .
that's where that other yellow thing goes .
can you put it in there ?
you know what we've gotta do ?
we gotta stop this and s start on this one okay ?
maybe after we're all through with this we can go back to this okay ?
yeah .
but we have to finish and do something else honey .
see this ?
we have to look behind this and figure out what's in there okay ?
do you wanna look and see what's in there ?
first let's clean this up and put it back in the box .
i think this goes over there .
no .
no the other way .
yeah .
oh it doesn't fit i think maybe we have to start all over again .
well there was another one of those too .
where is that ?
this is where the wheel went .
whoops ?
okay .
oh there it is .
ah yeah .
that's right .
you're right .
you're absolutely right .
what ?
maybe .
we've gotta few screws left over .
that's right .
no i think you had it right the first time .
pretty smart .
see those little holes there ?
there .
there .
there we go .
hm ?
here .
give me one more .
now we have two things left over .
where do you suppose those belong ?
i don't know where they belong .
oh okay did you wanna put it back in the box ?
and then you come over and take this curtain off .
or do you want me to put it back in the box ?
oh you're right .
you're absolutely right .
yeah .
there .
see i never could figure that out .
want the other one ?
okay .
you were right .
okay can you put it back in the box ?
and now you're finished with that .
okay here .

she said they will never live here again .
here at charleswood park ?
because when they .

cleveland ?
kathy his wife .
why ?
because when they applied when they talked to the management and the management said told them the rent said that parking would be extra and then said we have a beautiful pool and tennis club they did not tell them that was extra .
oh really ?
and they only found that out when they got here .
did they did they join ?
plus the fact that she has cockroaches and she's about ready to go out of her mind .
did they join ?
well they complained to the management and they have a free pool membership .
do they really ?
but they don't use it very often but she didn't join the tennis club .
they do have a free one because of their .
well you know that's misrepresentation .
you know .
some rental agent just tried to make it sound better than it was .

what do you mean you're anxious ?
we're anxious to know when julie and .
but how are you gonna know ?

frank if you do not eat every bite of that you'll never buy a twinkie again .
i'm telling you i let you have half of it and this is my reward .

it's very good .
you must eat some ma this amount that i'm cutting up .
well you can eat it i'm sure .

he wants a raw carrot that's what .
oh a raw carrot .
oh you don't want any cauliflower do you ?

uh so i would like you to take the latest letter that we got to lee highler right ?
or call him and read it to him .
i'm going there monday .
right ?
okay that's fine .
because they are saying we still have to pay the penalty and now and i gave all of it to lee .
i don't have a copy of their penalty bill so if that's what we're going to have to do .
and lee if lee says anything he's .
oh i'm sorry frank .
i'll take those .
if lee says anything you tell him that .
you know there was a record in our tax information that we had paid all those late .
but i'm .
sure he won't say anything .
and they auh .
wonderful !
okay you're doing very well .
you want some more now ?
i'll give him the other half .
got it all over the place .
you know where we might go ?
one of these days ?
remember leon rabinowitz .
from winthrop ?
remember leon ?
he's got a boat .
he's got a boat .
oh i'll cut it small .
tiny little pieces then .
do you think you'd like to go on a sail boat ?
yeah yes .
you don't want to go on a sail boat ?
does that answer your question ?
no .
you won't .
you can swim .
you wear a life jacket honey .
you've got your life jacket .
you know what your life jacket does ?
if you do fall in the water it keeps you afloat .
it keeps you up so your head up out of water .
here .
is that small enough ?
no but it keeps your head above water so .
and leo is a good sailor and i'm sure nothing will happen in the boat and your daddy will be with you .
okay now those two pieces are five ounces .
harold .
that's what you're allowed ?
and i can have six .
i could have another ounce .
that's an awful lot of meat .
i know so you want me to see if your other piece is ready yet ?
alright .
uh now you are allowed eight ounces i think .
no i'm not gonna finish up mine .
that's plenty .
how old are you frank ?
you're eight years old .
five and one quarter .
think next time you go off the board you know i think you'll dive in instead of jump in okay ?
you can't go off the board .
yes you can .
i thought the life guard said he couldn't .
when he swims the length of the pool he can go off the board ?
that's going to be quite a while .

just find another kid to play with .
and then don't you need more that one kid to play with .
what if no one with play with you ?
no one at all .
what if your brother won't play with you ?
brothers always play huh .
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play ?
that's smart ross ?
he's a smart alec isn't he .
so you think sean should've done that because no one was being being nice to him he should've just left .
that's a good idea .
so you don't ever want to be nice to sean huh .
how come ?
well how about grandma .
are you ever going to be nice to her .
she pokes you ?
she doesn't always poke you ?
she likes you ross ?
grandma really likes you !
she buys things presents for your birthday .
what if she promised not to do that anymore ?
what if we got grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then ?
no but what if she really stopped it ?
no wait ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her .
but you're going to get old someday too .
well how old is your mommy ?
because you should learn how old your mommy is that's how you you should know .
your mommy's thirty eight .
when you write on the the mothers day present for her and on her birthday present you have to to know how old she is ?
okay .
are you going to be mean to old people .
just because grandma is old are you going to be mean to her ?
think about it .
you have your own body .
kind of but sometimes you have to think about other people like like sean and grandma and .
no one makes you and you shouldn't yell .
because people i'll tell you the reason .
do you remember about about god ?
do you remember god ?
okay god wanted people to be nice to each other ?
you don't believe in god .
okay well then what makes you want to be nice to other people .
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you .
and you wouldn't have any more friends ?
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids .
think about it .
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody .
let's think about a world where everyone is nice ?
i'm not bossing you .
i'm asking you to use your head .
you don't want to think about other people huh .
you don't think about being nice to other children .
well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids .
okay i'll tell you the rules .
do you want me to tell you the rules ?
then i should tell you beforehand .
okay every time you go to a party with kids ?
listen let me tell the whole rules ?
i'll tell you the whole deal ?
whenever you go to a party with kids you have to be nice to all the kids ?
when you go to school you have to be nice to all the kids at school ?
and when you go on a picnic and a boy scout party you have to be be nice to all those kids to and you'll have to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the mall you have to be nice to everybody ?
ross that's not nice to your father .
your father's heart is going to break ross .
yes ?
that's it and there'll be no more father for you .
well then you'll be nasty to her and her heart will break ?
but they're too old and you don't love them .
well but if you don't love them if you want to just be nice to me i'm not really old and i don't poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so i wouldn't die .
you do .
but you didn't want to talk about my things i was talking about .
it's not with your body ?
ross it's not your body you're doing things ?
because you have a good little heart .
you want to really listen to the answer ?
wait a second .
wait ?
it means that there is an answer to your question .
are you ready to listen to the answer ?
in your heart you know right here where your heart is .
you're not listening .
right in here is your heart .
if you have a good lovely chocolate heart then you want to be be good to other people ?
if you have a mean hexy heart sketzy heart .
do you know what what sketzies were like ?
then you want to be mean to other people .
are you a sketzy ?
yeah ?
why .
the grogg in raggedy ann ?
now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then you'll go and you'll help him .
you don't have a warm nice heart ?
you don't to be a friend of brothers .
see i know you love brothers .
okay no more talking about it ?
i'm not going to boss you ever again .
i'm finished bossing ?
i know you have good warm heart and you'll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore .
so that's the end of my bossing you .
really .
that's a dirty trick !
are you going to try to do things so that they'll make me mad ?
no okay .
no that's not the dirty trick that's not the deal !
the deal is that i just stop bossing you and you do the good things for yourself ?

isn't he ugly .
he's the ugliest of all those guys .
he looks like a mer man .
mer man .

ross said he has short legs and i said he doesn't have short legs ?
it's only when his legs are pushed up .
ross you sound like you have a cold .
do you have a little cold ?
how should you know ?
because you know how you feel .
you know how your body feels ?
you can't feel your body .

because what will i say .

ross tell mommy the whole background to this about how there's there's a friend of yours who thinks there is fire bird and all those .
and flier bird .
okay who's this friend ross ?
who are you talking about ?
hold on a second .
barry barry .
is barry in your grade .
okay you sit here and tell me the whole story .
you don't want to to do it lying around .
okay .
now what do you think barry what happens with barry .
what did you figure out ?
and i said maybe it's true .
maybe there is a commercial .
and you said may be .
maybe what .
the third one .
what is the third one ross ?
the third set .
okay what are the first two sets of he man .
what what are the other sets of he man ?
what set is this ross ?
yeah you already said battle cat ?
okay and what's the other the second bunch .
what does it mean in between ?
how do you know that it's in between ?
how do you know that it's in between ?
why isn't he .
why isn't he in the first bunch .
why isn't he in the first bunch ?
why isn't fakir in the first bunch .
fakir .
yeah why isn't fakir in the first bunch .
he came out when did he come out .
aha .
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch ?
he's the last one of the first bunch .
but where do you see him .
where do they and when they make ads where do they put fakir ?
they don't add him anymore .
and what is the third bunch .
and what is the third bunch .
but don't you think that zoar might be flier bird .
what does zoar do ?
what would he be ?
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch .
what are they ?
supposing i didn't know about them .
oh you don't me to tell you you don't want me to tell .
but you know something .
ross that you didn't figure out ?
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back did fakir ever get in those .
are you sure .
is fakir in the second bunch ?
so they never put fakir in any of the bunches .
yeah the did .
you made a mistake ross ?
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak fakir into into those pictures .
yup they did .
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that ?
how would that prove it ?
where are we going to find that ?
you mean at the toy store .
i know how you can tell .
the toys have numbers .
issue numbers .
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers .
you can compare the numbers ?
but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why i just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys ?
i'm sure that there will be a third wave .
you mean roots .
an orchid .
isn't he a terrible little brother .
why isn't he as bad as i think he is .
but he does understand some things .
i do understand .
do you understand mark ?
yes ?
he does understand ?
what does he not understand ?
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things .
no it makes two infinities and eight ?
and that is an unreal number ?
that's a fantasy number ?
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number .
because you could never really get there in reality .
in reality you can get to infinity ?
right because you'd have to live forever .
yes .
so it's fantasy .
infinity is fantasy .
good night .
good night mom ?
what was the hardest part of your day ?
okay what was the hardest part of your day .

yeah ross i did .
they were messing up the car .
i sure hope todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it .
if they do we'll have to tell them about the exciting part they missed .
one of the guys disappeared just like the wicked witch in the wizard of oz .
who ?
oh really .
how about marian ?
marian didn't do it ?
you go one two three four five six seven eight ?

i wasn't there sunday john .
three weeks ago .
you weren't there .
you weren't there the last time i was there .
that must have been the night you spent the night at grandmommy and granddaddy's .
was that the sunday you made valentines ?
what are you working on now john ?
i mean right now here on your lego set are you rearranging it ?
building something else .
did you and daddy talk about your tornado nap awhile ago ?
did you ?
oh you already talked about it .
okay .
well you can go ahead and start playing that game if you want to .
okay which game do you want to play ?
well we could work on your activity book .
you want to do something in your activity book ?
some of those word games .
well why don't we do some of those that would be better .
okay okay we're going to need a pencil you got a pencil john ?
i don't know if i can hear you .
okay an extra pencil please .
i only have a pen .
that ought to work .
okay .
okay john .
okay the x man fill in is that what we're going to do ?
okay why don't you read me the directions and i'll see what we're supposed to do .
okay ah this is like the cross word puzzle right you have to figure out where all these words go .
okay can you read them ?
okay then so we have to find the place where that's going to fit in .
okay .
uh huh makes like a cross word puzzle .
this is a different kind of cross word puzzle .
well we have to see how many words have four spaces in them and i think i only see one place .
can you find it look around and see it's going down ?
no see that's a whole word right there that'd be too big .
what about right there ?
yeah but it will when we get them all filled in see they're going to all go together .
see in this kind of cross word puzzle they don't give you the clues they just give you the words but you have to figure out where they go .
okay well you can check that one off .
right just so you know you did it okay now pick another word that see they've got them separated into how many letters are in the word .
okay now we're going to have to look around for a .
that's right .
and what does it end in ?
okay that must be it okay .
okay there's one more with five letters .
that's teens .
that would be like if you're age thirteen to nineteen you would be in your teens .
a teenager .
i don't know why that's in there .
it looks like a kind of strange word for superheroes doesn't it ?
maybe so but if you look around there will be one more word with five letters in it .
one more word a five letter word can you find where that is ?
uh huh .
okay well all those four have seven letters so that might be a little harder because you're going to have to figure out the right place to put it .
okay that's seven letters so that'll be a hint .
it could be either that one or that one couldn't it ?
well let's see where the other seven letter ones are .
well it's going to be hard i tell you what let's figure out what word this is .
it will give you a hint find a word down there that starts with a c .
one two three four five six seven it has eight letters .
there's only one word with eight letters isn't there ?
that's colossus .
is that a person in superheroes ?
you never heard of that one ?
okay i'll write that one down .
see then this is going to give you a hint um the other words that go across this way .
one two three four five six seven .
okay so one is here seven letter words that will go in there .
which one would that be ?
the fourth letter has to be the f doesn't it ?
okay what word is this ?
banshee is that in superheroes ?
i don't know about that .
